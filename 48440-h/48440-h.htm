<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>The Old English Dramatists, the friends and co-temporaries
of Shakspeare, have contributed one of
the most valuable portions to the poetic literature
of our country. But&mdash;abounding as they do in
wit and fancy, in force and copiousness of expression,
in truth and variety of character, in rapid
change of incidents, in striking and interesting
situations, and, above all, in justice and elevation
of sentiment&mdash;their works are totally unknown to
the generality of readers, and are only found in
the hands of an adventurous few, who have deviated
from the beaten paths of study to explore
for themselves less familiar and exhausted tracts of
literary amusement. The neglect of these authors,
in an age so favourable to works of imagination as
the present, can only be ascribed to that occasional
coarseness of language which intermixes with and
pollutes the beauty of their most exquisite scenes.
For what may be termed the licentiousness of the
stage, for immorality of principle, for that offence
which was transplanted from France to England
with the court of Charles the Second, our old
dramatists do not require the aid of any apologist.
They are innocent of attempting to confound the
notions of right and wrong, or of seeking to influence
the bad passions of our nature against the
first great principles of morals. These were the
corruptions of a later and more vicious age. With
the earlier play-writers, the bent of the story and
the interest of the spectator are always directed to
the side of virtue; but the objection against them
is, that though they armed themselves in her cause,
they were too little scrupulous what kind of weapon
they employed. The worst things are always called
by the worst names. Nothing is sacrificed to delicacy.
The grossest subjects are treated, whenever they
happen to occur&mdash;and no care is taken to avoid them&mdash;in
the grossest terms. Vice loses none of her
enormity by any diminution of her coarseness. If
the wicked are introduced, they are painted with
a perfect truth of nature; they are represented
as loathsome in language as they are detestable in
conduct; and are rendered as offensive to the
reader of cultivated taste and virtuous habits as
they would be in the actual intercourse of
life. However well it may have suited the less polished
age of Elizabeth and James thus to inculcate purity
by exhibiting all the corruptions of the depraved, and
to fortify the moral principle by portraying wickedness,
with all its hateful accompaniments, as an
object of disgust as well as abhorrence and contempt,
such strong pictures are no longer tolerable
at the present day, and the recurrence of them
militates against that general circulation and approval
which is otherwise due to the great merit
of the works in which they occur. Under these
circumstances, the Editors of the Family Library
have determined on publishing a selection from the
plays of Massinger, Beaumont, Fletcher, Ford,
Shirley, Webster, Middleton, and others, omitting
all such scenes and passages as are inconsistent
with the delicacy and refinement of modern taste
and manners. Whenever it is possible, the play
will be printed entire. If there be a double plot,
the one, as in the case of the Virgin-Martyr,
eminently beautiful, and the other as eminently
offensive, the living beauty will be separated from
the dead weight of corruption to which it is unnaturally
joined, and be presented to the reader in
a form which may afford an unmixed and flowing
enjoyment to his imagination. When there is a
radical evil in the groundwork of the play, only
a single act or a few scenes may be given; but, in
such cases, care will always be taken to preserve
the interest of an entire and connected story.</p>

<p>The work will be accompanied with short explanatory
notes, and occasional critical remarks.</p>

<h2><a name="LIFE_OF_MASSINGER" id="LIFE_OF_MASSINGER">LIFE OF MASSINGER.</a></h2>


<p>Very few materials exist for a life of Massinger
beyond the entries of the Parish Register or the
College Books, and a few slender intimations scattered
here and there in the dedications to his plays.
From these scanty sources the following brief memoir
is derived.</p>

<p>Our author was born at Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in the year
1584: he was the son of Arthur Massinger, a gentleman
in the service of Henry, the second Earl of
Pembroke<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. We must not suppose, from his being
thus attached to the family of a nobleman, that the
father of our poet was a person of inferior birth and
station. In those days the word servant carried
with it no sense of degradation. The great lords
and officers of the court numbered inferior nobles
among their followers. We read, in Cavendish's
Life of Wolsey, that "my Lord Percy, the son and
heir of the Earl of Northumberland, attended upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and was servitor to the lord-cardinal<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>:" and from
the situation which Arthur Massinger held in the
household of so high and influential a person as the
Earl of Pembroke, we might be justly led to argue
rather favourably than unfavourably of his family
and his connexions. "There were," says Mr. Gifford,
"many considerations which united to render
this state of dependance respectable and even honourable.
The secretaries, clerks, and assistants,
of various departments, were not then, as now,
nominated by the government, but left to the
choice of the person who held the employment;
and as no particular dwelling was officially set
apart for their residence, they were entertained in
the house of their principal. That communication,
too, between noblemen of power and trust, both of a
public and private nature, which is now committed
to the post, was in those days managed by confidential
servants, who were despatched from one
to the other, and even to the sovereign<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>;" and, indeed,
the father of our poet himself was, we know,
in one instance thus employed as the bearer of communications
from his patron to Elizabeth. We
read in The Sidney Letters<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, "Mr. Massinger
is newly come up from the Earl of Pembroke with
letters to the queen for his lordship's leave to be
away this St. George's Day." This was an errand
which would not have been intrusted to the execution
of any inconsiderable person: unimportant as
the occasion may appear to us, it would not have
been regarded in that light by Elizabeth; for no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
monarch ever exacted from the nobility, and particularly
from her officers of state, a more rigid and scrupulous
compliance with stated order than this princess.</p>

<p>With regard to the early youth of Massinger,
we possess no information whatever. Mr. Gifford
supposes that it might have been passed at Wilton,
a seat belonging to the Earl of Pembroke, in the
neighbourhood of Salisbury; but this mode of disposing
of his early years rests on a very improbable
conjecture. It may occasionally have happened
that the child of a favourite dependant was admitted
as the companion of the younger branches
of the patron's family, and allowed to receive his
education among them; but this was certainly not
an ordinary case; and, like Cavendish, a large
majority of the great man's servants and dependants
"left wife and <i>children</i>, home and family,
rest and quietness, only to serve him<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>."&mdash;Massinger
was most likely educated at the grammar-school of
Salisbury, where many distinguished characters
have received the rudiments of their education,
among whom the elegant and accomplished Addison
is to be numbered. But wherever the first
years of our poet's life may have been spent, and
whatever may have been the nature of his education,
we know that at the age of eighteen (May 14,
1602) he was entered at the university of Oxford,
and became a commoner of St. Alban's Hall<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>Massinger resided at Oxford about four years,
and then abruptly left it, without taking any
degree. The cause of this sudden departure is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
ascribed by Mr. Gifford to the death of his father,
from whom his supplies were derived: but Davies
relates a very different story, and asserts that the
Earl of Pembroke, who had sent him to the university
and maintained him there, withdrew the
necessary allowance in consequence of his having
misapplied the time demanded for severer studies,
in the pursuit of a more attractive but less profitable
description of literature. Each opinion is
equally ungrounded on the basis of any substantial
evidence, and rests almost entirely on the imagination
of the biographer: what slight authority there
is favours the latter supposition, which, perhaps,
on the whole, is most consistent with the known
circumstances of the case. Anthony Wood, who
was born, lived, and died at Oxford; who spent
his time in collecting and recording the gossip
which circulated in the university respecting the
characters and conduct of its more distinguished
sons; and whose evidence, however indifferent it
may be, is the best that can be obtained upon the
subject, confirms the representation of Davies:&mdash;"Massinger,"
says Wood, "gave his mind more
to poetry and romance, for about four years or
more, than to logic and philosophy, which <i>he
ought to have done, as he was patronised to that
end</i>." This passage corroborates the account of
Davies so far as to intimate that patronage was
afforded to our author, and that cause of dissatisfaction
was given to the patron; but it goes no
farther: it does not even state to whom the poet
was indebted for assistance, nor that the misapplication
of his academic hours was at all resented
by the friend from whom the assistance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
received: but still Wood is very probably correct
in his information that other than his paternal
funds were depended upon for maintaining Massinger
at the university; and if such was the case,
there can be no question from whose hands they
must have proceeded; while the simple fact of his
having been totally neglected, from the time of his
father's death, by the whole of the Pembroke family,
till after the demise of the earl, carries with
it a strong suspicion that some offence was committed
on the side of the poet, and tenaciously
remembered on the side of the peer. Henry, the
second Earl of Pembroke, died (1601) the year
before Massinger was admitted at Oxford; and
William, the third earl, to whom the father of
Massinger continued attached during life, is universally
and justly considered one of the brightest
ornaments of the courts of Elizabeth and James.
He was a man of generous and liberal disposition;
the distinguished patron of arts and learning; and
a lover of poetry, which he himself cultivated with
some degree of success. It is not probable&mdash;it is
impossible&mdash;that such a man should have allowed
the highly talented son of an old and faithful
servant of his family to be checked in his course
of study, and abandoned to maintain, through the
early years of life, a single-handed contest with
adversity, for the want of that pecuniary aid which
he could have yielded and never missed, unless
some strong and decided cause of displeasure had
existed. Had Massinger been merely forced to
leave the university, as Mr. Gifford supposes, because
the funds necessary to maintain him there
had failed with the life of his father, we impute
an act of illiberality to the Earl of Pembroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
which is inconsistent with the whole tenor of his
life and character. From whatever source the
expenses of our author's education were originally
defrayed, their suddenly ceasing argues in favour
of the account intimated by Wood and detailed by
Davies. If his father had, during his life, supported
him at the university, there must have been
some reason for the earl's not continuing that support
when the father of Massinger was no more;
and perhaps the most honourable supposition for
both parties is that which represents the earl as
offended by the bent of our author's studies and pursuits.
By adopting this view of the case we are saved
from the painful necessity of either assuming, on
the one hand, that a nobleman distinguished among
the most amiable characters of his age allowed a
highly gifted and meritorious young man, a natural
dependant of his house, to languish in the
want of that countenance and protection on which
he had an hereditary claim; or, on the other hand,
that Massinger had incurred the displeasure of his
natural and hereditary patron by the commission of
some more crying offence.</p>

<p>Every, even the slightest, surmise of Mr. Gifford
is deserving attention and respect; but I cannot
admit the supposition by which he would account
for the alienation that subsisted between the Earl
of Pembroke and our author. That distinguished
critic has inferred, from the religious sentiments
contained in The Virgin Martyr, that Massinger
was a Roman catholic, and for that cause neglected
by the protector of his father. But if the intimations
scattered through this play and others should
be received as sufficient evidence of the faith of
Massinger, we must, on similar evidence&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
intimations contained in Measure for Measure, for
instance&mdash;conclude that the religion of Shakspeare
was the same; and then we are cast back upon our
old difficulty, and have to explain why William
Earl of Pembroke, a celebrated patron of literary
men, and of dramatists in particular, scorned to yield
his notice to the catholic Massinger, while (to use
the expression of Heminge and Condell) he "prosequuted"
the catholic Shakspeare and "his works
with so much favour<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>?" There are many reasons
for believing Shakspeare to have been a member of
the church of Rome; and the patronage afforded
him by the Earl of Pembroke proves, that that
nobleman extended his liberality to men of genius
without any regard to distinctions of faith; but,
on the other hand, we have no just grounds for
assuming that Massinger really did hold the same
opinions. The only evidence we have upon this
point, that afforded by the general tone of his
writings, is of a most vague and superficial description.
What, in fact, can be inferred from it?
We may from such a source derive very satisfactory
information respecting the sentiments which
would be favourably received by the audience, but
very little respecting those of the author. The
truth is, that though the national religion was reformed
in its liturgy and articles, the feelings, prejudices,
and superstitions of the people were still
almost entirely catholic; and Massinger, like any
other dramatic author, writing for the amusement of
the people, necessarily addressed them in a language
they would understand, and with sentiments that
accorded with their own. Besides, as a poet, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
would never carry his theological distinctions to his
literary labours: Voltaire himself is catholic in
his tragedies; and Massinger naturally adopted the
creed which was most suitable to the purposes of
poetry, and afforded the most picturesque ceremonies
and romantic situations. I feel inclined, therefore,
to dismiss entirely the theory suggested by Mr.
Gifford, for these two reasons; first, supposing our
author to have been a catholic, we have no reason
for condemning the Earl of Pembroke as a bigot
and a persecutor, who would close his eyes to the
merits of so great an author, because his faith did
not tally with his own; and, secondly, we have no
sufficient grounds for supposing him to have been a
catholic at all. But with regard to all such visionary
conjectures, thinking is literally a waste of thought.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the nature of Massinger's
studies at Oxford, it is quite certain, from
the general character of his works, that his time
could not have been wasted there; and his literary
acquirements, at the period of his leaving the university,
appear to have been multifarious and extensive.
He was about two-and-twenty (1606)
when he arrived in London, where, as he more than
once observes, he was driven by his necessities, and
somewhat inclined, perhaps, by the peculiar bent of his
talents, to dedicate himself to the service of the stage.</p>

<p>The theatre, when Massinger first took up his
abode in the metropolis, must have presented attractions
of all others the most calculated to excite
the interest, and inspire the imagination, of a young
man of sensibility, taste, and education like our poet.
No art ever attained a more rapid maturity than
the dramatic art in England. The people had, indeed, been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
long accustomed to a species of exhibition,
called <span class="smcap">Miracles</span> or <span class="smcap">Mysteries</span>, founded on sacred
subjects, and performed by the ministers of religion
themselves, on the holy festivals, in or near the
churches, and designed to instruct the ignorant in
the leading facts of sacred history<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. From the occasional
introduction of allegorical characters, such
as Faith, Death, Hope, or Sin, into these religious
dramas, representations of another kind, called
<span class="smcap">Moralities</span>, had by degrees arisen, of which the
plots were more artificial, regular, and connected,
and which were entirely formed of such personifications:
but the first rough draught of a regular
tragedy and comedy&mdash;Lord Sackville's Gorboduc,
and Still's Gammer Gurton's Needle<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;were not
produced till within the latter half of the sixteenth
century, and little more than twenty years before
the stage acquired its highest splendour in the productions
of Shakspeare.</p>

<p>About the end of the sixteenth century, the
attention of the public began to be more generally
directed to the drama; and it throve most admirably
beneath the cheering beams of popular favour. The
theatrical performances which in the early part of
Elizabeth's reign had been exhibited on temporary
stages, erected in such halls or apartments as the
actors could procure, or, more generally, in the
yards of the larger inns, while the spectators surveyed
them from the surrounding windows and
galleries, began to find more convenient and permanent
habitations. About the year 1569, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
regular playhouse, under the appropriate name of
The Theatre, was erected. It is supposed to have
stood somewhere in Blackfriars; and, three years
after the commencement of this establishment, the
queen, yielding to her own inclination for such
amusements, and disregarding the remonstrances of
the Puritans, granted licence and authority to the
servants of the Earl of Leicester ("for the recreation
of her loving subjects, as for her own solace
and pleasure when she should think good to see
them") to exercise their occupation throughout the
whole realm of England. From this time the
number of theatres increased with the increasing
demands of the people. Various noblemen had
their respective companies of performers, who were
associated as their servants, and acted under their
protection; and when Massinger left Oxford, and
commenced dramatic author, there were no less
than seven principal theatres open in the metropolis.</p>

<p>With respect to the interior arrangements, there
were very few points of difference between our
modern theatres and those of the days of Massinger.
The prices of admission, indeed, were considerably
cheaper: to the boxes the entrance was a shilling;
to the pit and galleries only sixpence. Sixpence
also was the price paid for stools upon the stage;
and these seats, as we learn from Decker's Gull's
Hornbook, were particularly affected by the wits
and critics of the time. The conduct of the audience
was less restrained by the sense of public
decorum, and smoking tobacco, playing at cards,
eating and drinking, were generally prevalent
among them. The hours of performance were also
earlier: the play commencing at one o'clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
During the representation a flag was unfurled at
the top of the theatre; and the stage, according to
the universal practice of the age, was strewn with
rushes; but, in all other respects, the theatres of
Elizabeth and James's days seem to have borne a
perfect resemblance to our own. They had their
pit, where the inferior class of spectators, <i>the
groundlings</i>, vented their clamorous censure or
approbation; they had their boxes&mdash;<i>rooms</i> as they
were called&mdash;to which the right of exclusive admission
was engaged by the night, for the more
affluent portion of the audience; and there were
again the galleries, or <i>scaffoldings</i> above the boxes,
for those who were content to purchase less commodious
situations at a cheaper rate. On the stage,
in the same manner, the appointments appear to have
been nearly of the same description as at present.
The curtain divided the audience from the actors,
which, at the third sounding, not indeed of the <i>bell</i>,
but of the <i>trumpet</i>, was drawn for the commencement
of the performance. Malone, in his account of the
ancient theatre, supposes that there were no moveable
scenes; that a permanent elevation of about
nine feet was raised at the back of the stage, from
which, in many of the old plays, part of the dialogue
was spoken; and that there was a private
box on each side this platform. Such an arrangement
would have destroyed all theatrical illusion;
and it seems extraordinary that any spectators
should desire to fix themselves in a station where
they could have seen nothing but the backs and
trains of the performers; but, as Malone himself
acknowledges the spot to have been inconvenient,
and that "it is not very easy to ascertain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
precise situation where these boxes really were<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>", it
may very reasonably be presumed, that they were
not placed in the position that the historian of the
English stage has supposed. As to the permanent
floor, or <i>upper stage</i>, of which he speaks, he may or
may not be correct in his statement. All that his
quotations upon the subject really establish is, that
in the old, as in the modern theatre, when the
actor was to speak from a window, or balcony, or
the walls of a fortress, the requisite ingenuity was
not wanting to contrive a representation of the
place. But with regard to the use of painted
moveable scenery, it is not possible, from the very
circumstances of the case, to believe him correct in
his theory. Such a contrivance could not have
escaped our ancestors. All the materials were
ready to their hands. They had not to invent for
themselves, but merely to adapt an old invention to
that peculiar purpose; and at a time when every
better-furnished apartment was adorned with tapestry;
when even the rooms of the commonest
taverns were hung with painted cloths; while all
the materials were constantly before their eyes, we
can hardly believe our forefathers to have been so
deficient in ingenuity, as to have missed the simple
contrivance of converting the common ornaments of
their walls into the decorations of their theatres.
But, in fact, the use of scenery was almost co-existent
with the introduction of dramatic representations
in this country. In the Chester Mysteries
(1268), the most ancient and complete collection of
the kind which we possess, is found the following
stage direction: "Then Noe shall go into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
arke with all his familye, his wife excepte. <i>The
arke must be boarded round about; and upon the
boardes all the beastes and fowles, hereafter rehearsed,
must be painted</i>, that their wordes may
agree with their pictures<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>." In this passage we
have a clear reference to a painted scene. It is not
likely that, in the lapse of three centuries, while all
other arts were in a state of rapid improvement, and
the art of dramatic writing, perhaps, more rapidly
and successfully improved than any other, the art
of theatrical decoration should have alone stood
still. It is not improbable that their scenes were
few; and that they were varied, as occasion might
require, by the introduction of different pieces of
stage furniture. Mr. Gifford, who adheres to the
opinions of Malone, says, "A table with a pen and
ink thrust in, signified that the stage was a counting-house;
if these were withdrawn and two stools
put in their place, it was then a tavern<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>." And
this might be perfectly satisfactory as long as the
business of the play was supposed to be passing
within doors; but when it was removed to the open
air, such meagre devices would no longer be sufficient
to guide the imagination of the audience,
and some new method must have been adopted to
indicate the place of action. After giving the
subject very considerable attention, I cannot help
thinking that Steevens was right in rejecting Malone's
theory, and concluding that the spectators
were, as at the present day, assisted in following
the progress of the story by means of painted moveable
scenery. This opinion is confirmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
ancient stage directions. In the folio Shakspeare,
1623, we read "Enter Brutus <i>in his orchard</i>;
Enter Timon <i>in the woods</i>; Enter Timon <i>from
the cave</i>." In Coriolanus, "Marcius follows them
<i>to the gates and is shut in</i>." Innumerable instances
of the same kind might be cited to prove that the
ancient stage was not so defective in the necessary
decorations as some antiquaries of great authority
would represent. "It may be added," says
Steevens, "that the dialogue of our old dramatists
has such perpetual reference to objects supposed
visible to the audience, that the want of scenery
could not have failed to render many of the descriptions
absurd. Banquo examines the outside
of Inverness castle with such minuteness, that he
distinguishes even the nests which the martens had
built under the projecting part of its roof. Romeo,
standing in a garden, points to the tops of fruit-trees
gilded by the moon. The prologue speaker
to the second part of Henry the Fourth expressly
shows the spectators '<i>This</i> worm-eaten hold of
ragged stone,' in which Northumberland was
lodged. Iachimo takes the most exact inventory of
every article in Imogen's bed-chamber, from the
silk and silver of which her tapestry was wrought,
down to the Cupids that support her andirons. Had
not the inside of the apartment, with its proper
furniture, been represented, how ridiculous must
the action of Iachimo have appeared! He must
have stood looking out of the room for the particulars
supposed to be visible within it." The
works of Massinger would afford innumerable instances
of a similar kind to vindicate the opinion
which Steevens has asserted on the testimony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Shakspeare alone. But on this subject there is
one passage which appears to me quite conclusive.
Must not all the humour of the mock play in The
Midsummer Night's Dream have been entirely lost,
unless the audience before whom it was performed
were accustomed to all the embellishments requisite
to give effect to a dramatic representation, and
could consequently estimate the absurdity of those
shallow contrivances and mean substitutes for scenery
devised by the ignorance of the clowns<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>?</p>

<p>In only one respect do I perceive any material
difference between the mode of representation at
the time of Massinger and at present: in his day,
the female parts were performed by boys. This
custom, which must in many cases have materially
injured the illusion of the scene, was in others of
considerable advantage: it furnished the stage with
a succession of youths, regularly educated for the
art, to fill, in every department of the drama, the
characters suited to their age. When the lad had
become too tall for Juliet, he had acquired the
skill, and was most admirably fitted, both in age and
appearance, for performing the part which Garrick
considered the most difficult on the stage, because
it needed "an old head upon young shoulders,"
the ardent and arduous character of Romeo. When
the voice had "the mannish crack," that rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the youth unfit to appear as the representative of
the gentle Imogen, the stage possessed in him the
very person that was wanting to do justice to the
princely sentiments of Arviragus or Guiderius<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the stage when Massinger
arrived in the metropolis, and dedicated his talents
to its service. He joined a splendid fraternity, for
Shakspeare, Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Shirley,
were then flourishing at the height of their reputation,
and the full vigour of their genius.
Massinger came among them no unworthy competitor
for such honours and emoluments as the
theatre could afford. Of the honours, indeed, he
seems to have reaped a very fair and equitable
portion; of the emoluments, the harvest was less
abundant. In those days, very little pecuniary
reward was to be gained by the dramatic poet,
unless, as indeed was most frequently the case, he
added the profession of the actor to that of the
author, and recited the verses which he wrote. The
distinguished performers of that time, Alleyn, Burbage,
Heminge, Condell, Shakspeare, all appear to
have died in independent, if not affluent, circumstances;
but the remuneration obtained by the
poet was most miserably curtailed. The price
given at the theatre for a new play fluctuated
between ten and twenty pounds; the copyright,
if the piece was printed, might produce from six to
ten pounds more; in addition to these sums, the dedication-fee
may be reckoned, the usual amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
which was forty shillings. Our author appears to
have produced about two or three plays every year.
Most of them were successful; but, even with this
industry and good fortune, his annual income
would rarely have exceeded fifty pounds: and we
cannot, therefore, feel surprised at finding him
continually speaking of his necessities; or that the
only existing document connected with his life
should be one that represents him in a state of
pecuniary embarrassment.</p>

<p>Among the papers of Dulwich College, the indefatigable
Mr. Malone discovered the following letter
tripartite, which, coming from persons of such deserved
celebrity, cannot fail of interesting the reader.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"<i>To our most loving friend, Mr. Phillip Hinchlow,

</blockquote>

<p>The occasion of the distress in which these three
distinguished persons were involved it is not possible
to fathom. We may imagine a thousand
emergencies, either creditable or discreditable to
the fame of the writers, with which the letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
would perfectly tally; but, on such slight and
vague intimations, no ingenuity could determine
which was most likely to be correct. But from
the document a circumstance is ascertained, which,
before its discovery, had been called in question.
Sir Aston Cockayne, a friend of Massinger, had
asserted in a volume of poems, published in 1658,
that our author had written in conjunction with
Fletcher; Davies doubted this report, but the
above letter establishes the fact beyond the possibility
of dispute.</p>

<p>Massinger is known to have produced thirty-seven
plays for the stage, a list of which is given
at the conclusion of this memoir. Sixteen entire
plays and the fragment of another, The Parliament
of Love, alone are extant. No less than eleven of
his productions, in manuscript, were in possession
of Mr. Warburton (Somerset Herald), and destroyed
with the rest of that gentleman's invaluable
collection by his cook, who, ignorant of their worth,
used them as waste paper for the purposes of the
kitchen.</p>

<p>The great and various merits of the works of
Massinger will be better seen in the following
volumes than in any elaborate, critical dissertation.
If our author be compared with the other dramatic
writers of his age, we cannot long hesitate where
to place him. More natural in his characters and
more poetical in his diction than Jonson or Cartwright,
more elevated and nervous than Fletcher,
the only writers who can be supposed to contest his
pre-eminence, Massinger ranks immediately under
Shakspeare himself. Our poet excels, perhaps,
more in the description than in the expression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
passion; this may in some measure be ascribed to
his attention to the fable: while his scenes are
managed with consummate skill, the lighter shades
of character and sentiment are lost in the tendency
of each part to the catastrophe. The melody, force,
and variety of his versification are always remarkable.
The prevailing beauties of his productions
are dignity and elegance; their predominant fault
is want of passion.</p>

<p>Massinger's last play&mdash;which is unfortunately
lost&mdash;The Anchoress of Pausilippo, was acted
Jan. 26, 1640, about six weeks before his death,
which happened on the 17th of March, 1640. He
went to bed in good health, says Langbaine, and
was found dead in the morning, in his own house
on the Bankside. He was buried in the churchyard
of St. Saviour's, and the comedians paid the
last sad duty to his name, by attending him to the
grave.</p>

<p>It does not appear, though every stone and every
fragment of a stone has been carefully examined, that
any monument or inscription of any kind marked
the place where his dust was deposited. "The
memorial of his mortality," says Gifford, "is given
with a pathetic brevity, which accords but too well
with the obscure and humble passages of his life:
March 20, 1639-40, buried Philip Massinger, <span class="smcap lowercase">A
STRANGER</span>."</p>

<p>Such is all the information that remains to us
of this distinguished poet. But though we are
ignorant of every circumstance respecting him but
that he lived, wrote, and died, we may yet form
some idea of his personal character from the recommendatory
poems prefixed to his several plays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
in which, as Mr. Gifford justly observes, the language
of his panegyrists, though warm, expresses
an attachment apparently derived not so much
from his talents as his virtues: he is their <i>beloved</i>,
<i>much-esteemed</i>, <i>dear</i>, <i>worthy</i>, <i>deserving</i>, <i>honoured</i>,
<i>long-known</i>, and <i>long-loved friend</i>. All the writers
of his life represent him as a man of singular modesty,
gentleness, candour, and affability; nor does
it appear that he ever made or found an enemy.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VIRGIN-MARTYR" id="THE_VIRGIN-MARTYR">THE VIRGIN-MARTYR.</a></h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Virgin-Martyr.</span>] This very beautiful play, one
of Massinger's earliest and most popular works, was first
printed in 1622, but we have no account when it was first
produced. In the composition of it he was assisted by Decker,
a dramatist of no mean reputation.</p>

<p>The plot of this tragedy is founded on the tenth and last
general persecution of the Christians, which broke out in the
nineteenth year of Dioclesian's reign with a fury hard to be
expressed; the Christians being every where, without distinction
of age, sex, or condition, dragged to execution, and subjected
to the most exquisite torments that rage, cruelty, and
hatred could suggest.</p>

<p>In the construction of their play, Massinger and his associate
Decker appear to have conceived the idea of combining
the prominent parts of the old Mystery with the Morality,
which was not yet obliterated from the memories, nor perhaps
from the affections, of many of the spectators. Among the
many instances of skill displayed by the authors of The Virgin-Martyr
in the management of their materials may be
remarked the dexterity and good taste with which they have
avoided the untimely concurrence of the good and evil spirit;
an error into which Tasso and others of greater name than
Massinger have inadvertently fallen.&mdash;Of the character of the
heroine it is impossible to speak too highly: her genuine and
dignified piety, her unsullied innocence, her unshaken constancy,
her lofty pity for her persecutors, her calm contempt of torture,
and her heroic death, exalt the mind in no ordinary degree.
All the other parts are subordinate to her, and require little
observation. Antoninus is brave and generous, and we sympathize
with his genuine attachment for Dorothea. Calista
and Christeta, hasty, self-confident, readily promising for their
steadiness, soon forgetting their resolutions, and equally secure
in every change of opinion, are well contrasted with the heroine
of the piece, whose fixed principles always guard her against
rashness, and therefore preserve her from contradiction. Artemia's
love for Antoninus would be wholly without interest, if
we were not moved for a moment by her indignation at the
rejection of her offer; and we see her at length consigned to
Maximinus with as little emotion as is shown by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The introduction of a good and evil spirit disguised in human
shapes was not to be expected in a work aspiring to the reputation
of a regular tragedy: still, whatever be their departure from propriety,
it must be remembered that such representations had a
most solemn origin, and that the business in which the spirits are
engaged has a substantial conformity with the opinions of the
early ages in which the plot is laid. The opposition of the
demons to the progress of the faith, and the reasoning and
raillery which Dorothea expresses, under the influence of Angelo,
against the pagan gods, are to be found in Justin, Tatian,
Arnobius, and others. The separate agency of the spirits, and
the consequence of their personal encounter, are also described
in a characteristic manner.</p>

<p>Apart from Angelo, Harpax seems to advance in his malignant
work. When the daughters of Theophilus express their
zeal for paganism, he "grows fat to see his labours prosper;"
yet he cannot look forward to the defeat of those labours in
their approaching conversion, though on some occasions we
find he could "see a thousand leagues" in his master's service.
And this agrees with the doctrine, that when some signal
triumph of the faith was at hand, the evil spirits were abridged
of their usual powers. Again, when Harpax expects to meet
Angelo, he thus expresses the dread of his presence, and the
effect which it afterwards produced on him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I do so hate his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, should I look on him, I should sink down."<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Act II. sc. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this, too, perfectly agrees with the power attributed to the
superior spirits of quelling the demons by those indications of
their quality which were not to be perceived by mortals: <i>per
occultissim&aelig; signa pr&aelig;senti&aelig;, qu&aelig; angelicis sensibus etiam
malignorum spirituum, potius quam infirmitati hominum, possunt
esse perspicua</i>. Civ. Dei, lib. ix.</p>

<p>The tragedy is too full of horrors; but this is a fault of
which our ancestors were very tolerant.</p>

The holy pledges that the gods have given you,<br />
Your chaste, fair daughters. Were 't not to upbraid<br />
A service to a master not unthankful,<br />
I could say these, in spite of your prevention,<br />
Seduced by an imagined faith, not reason,<br />
(Which is the strength of nature) quite forsaking<br />
The Gentile gods, had yielded up themselves<br />
To this new-found religion. This I cross'd,<br />
Discover'd their intents, taught you to use,<br />
With gentle words and mild persuasions,<br />
The power and the authority of a father,<br />
Set off with cruel threats; and so reclaim'd them:<br />
And, whereas they with torment should have died,<br />
(Hell's furies to me, had they undergone it!)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">[Aside.</span><br />
They are now votaries in great Jupiter's temple,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>And, by his priest instructed, grown familiar<br />
With all the mysteries, nay, the most abstruse ones,<br />
Belonging to his deity.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> 'Twas a benefit,<br />
For which I ever owe you.&mdash;Hail, Jove's flamen!<br />
Have these my daughters reconciled themselves,<br />
Abandoning for ever the Christian way,<br />
To your opinion?</p>

<p><i>Priest.</i> And are constant in it.<br />
They teach their teachers with their depth of judgment,<br />
And are with arguments able to convert<br />
The enemies to our gods, and answer all<br />
They can object against us.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> My dear daughters!</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> We dare dispute against this new-sprung sect,<br />
In private or in public.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> My best lady,<br />
Pers&eacute;ver<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in it.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> And what we maintain,<br />
We will seal with our bloods.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Brave resolution!<br />
I e'en grow fat to see my labours prosper.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I young again. To your devotions.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Do&mdash;<br />
My prayers be present with you.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">[<i>Exeunt Priest</i>,</span> <span class="smcap">Cal.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Chris</span>.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> O my Harpax!<br />
Thou engine of my wishes, thou that steel'st<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>My bloody resolutions, thou that arm'st<br />
My eyes 'gainst womanish tears and soft compassion,<br />
Instructing me, without a sigh, to look on<br />
Babes torn by violence from their mothers' breasts<br />
To feed the fire, and with them make one flame;<br />
Old men, as beasts, in beasts' skins torn by dogs;<br />
Virgins and matrons tire the executioners;<br />
Yet I, unsatisfied, think their torments easy&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> And in that, just, not cruel.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Were all sceptres<br />
That grace the hands of kings made into one,<br />
And offer'd me, all crowns laid at my feet,<br />
I would contemn them all,&mdash;thus spit at them;<br />
So I to all posterities might be call'd<br />
The strongest champion of the Pagan gods,<br />
And rooter out of Christians.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Oh, mine own,<br />
Mine own dear lord! to further this great work,<br />
I ever live thy slave.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sapritius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sempronius</span>.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> No more&mdash;The governor.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Keep the ports close<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, and let the guards be doubled;<br />
Disarm the Christians; call it death in any<br />
To wear a sword, or in his house to have one.</p>

<p><i>Semp.</i> I shall be careful, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> 'Twill well become you.<br />
Such as refuse to offer sacrifice<br />
To any of our gods, put to the torture.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Grub up this growing mischief by the roots;<br />
And know, when we are merciful to them,<br />
We to ourselves are cruel.</p>

<p><i>Semp.</i> You pour oil<br />
On fire that burns already at the height:<br />
I know the emperor's edict, and my charge,<br />
And they shall find no favour.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> My good lord,<br />
This care is timely for the entertainment<br />
Of our great master, who this night in person<br />
Comes here to thank you.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Who! the emperor?</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> To clear your doubts, he doth return in triumph,<br />
Kings lackeying<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> by his triumphant chariot;<br />
And in this glorious victory, my lord,<br />
You have an ample share: for know, your son,<br />
The ne'er-enough commended Antoninus,<br />
So well hath flesh'd his maiden sword<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, and dyed<br />
His snowy plumes so deep in enemies' blood,<br />
That, besides public grace beyond his hopes,<br />
There are rewards propounded.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> I would know<br />
No mean in thine, could this be true.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> My head<br />
Answer the forfeit.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Of his victory<br />
There was some rumour: but it was assured,<br />
The army pass'd a full day's journey higher<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>Into the country.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> It was so determined;<br />
But, for the further honour of your son,<br />
And to observe the government of the city,<br />
And with what rigour, or remiss indulgence,<br />
The Christians are pursued, he makes his stay here:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">[<i>Trumpets.</i></span><br />
For proof, his trumpets speak his near arrival.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Haste, good Sempronius, draw up our guards,<br />
And with all ceremonious pomp receive<br />
The conquering army. Let our garrison speak<br />
Their welcome in loud shouts, the city show<br />
Her state and wealth.</p>

<p><i>Semp.</i> I'm gone.<span style="margin-left:15em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> O, I am ravish'd<br />
With this great honour! cherish, good Theophilus,<br />
This knowing scholar. Send for your fair daughters;<br />
I will present them to the emperor,<br />
And in their sweet conversion, as a mirror,<br />
Express your zeal and duty.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Fetch them, good Harpax.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">[<i>Exit</i></span> <span class="smcap">Harpax</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sempronius</span>, <i>at the head of the guard,
soldiers leading three kings bound</i>; <span class="smcap">Antoninus</span>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> So: at all parts I find C&aelig;sarea<br />
Completely govern'd: the licentious soldier<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Confined in modest limits, and the people<br />
Taught to obey, and not compell'd with rigour:<br />
The ancient Roman discipline revived,<br />
Which raised Rome to her greatness, and proclaim'd her<br />
The glorious mistress of the conquer'd world;<br />
But, above all, the service of the gods,<br />
So zealously observed, that, good Sapritius,<br />
In words to thank you for your care and duty,<br />
Were much unworthy Dioclesian's honour,<br />
Or his magnificence to his loyal servants.&mdash;<br />
But I shall find a time with noble titles<br />
To recompense your merits.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Mightiest C&aelig;sar,<br />
<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>Whose power upon this globe of earth is equal<br />
To Jove's in heaven; whose victorious triumphs<br />
On proud rebellious kings that stir against it,<br />
Are perfect figures of his immortal trophies<br />
Won in the Giants' war; whose conquering sword,<br />
Guided by his strong arm, as deadly kills<br />
As did his thunder! all that I have done,<br />
Or, if my strength were centupled, could do,<br />
Comes short of what my loyalty must challenge.<br />
But, if in any thing I have deserved<br />
Great C&aelig;sar's smile, 'tis in my humble care<br />
Still to preserve the honour of those gods,<br />
That make him what he is: my zeal to them<br />
I ever have express'd in my fell hate<br />
Against the Christian sect that, with one blow,<br />
(Ascribing all things to an unknown Power,)<br />
Would strike down all their temples, and allows them<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Nor sacrifice nor altars.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Thou, in this,<br />
Walk'st hand in hand with me: my will and power<br />
Shall not alone confirm, but honour all<br />
That are in this most forward.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Sacred C&aelig;sar,<br />
If your imperial majesty stand pleased<br />
To shower your favours upon such as are<br />
The boldest champions of our religion,<br />
Look on this reverend man, [<i>points to Theophilus.</i>] to whom the power<br />
Of searching out, and punishing such delinquents,<br />
Was by your choice committed; and, for proof,<br />
He hath deserved the grace imposed upon him,<br />
And with a fair and even hand proceeded,<br />
Partial to none, not to himself, or those<br />
Of equal nearness to himself; behold<br />
This pair of virgins.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> What are these?</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> His daughters.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Now by your sacred fortune, they are fair ones,<br />
Exceeding fair ones: would 'twere in my power<br />
To make them mine!</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> They are the gods', great lady,<br />
They were most happy in your service else:<br />
On these, when they fell from their father's faith,<br />
I used a judge's power, entreaties failing<br />
(They being seduced) to win them to adore<br />
The holy Powers we worship; I put on<br />
The scarlet robe of bold authority,<br />
And, as they had been strangers to my blood,<br />
Presented them in the most horrid form,<br />
All kind of tortures; part of which they suffer'd<br />
With Roman constancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><i>Artem.</i> And could you endure,<br />
Being a father, to behold their limbs<br />
Extended on the rack?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I did; but must<br />
Confess there was a strange contention in me,<br />
Between the impartial office of a judge,<br />
And pity of a father; to help justice<br />
Religion stept in, under which odds<br />
Compassion fell:&mdash;yet still I was a father.<br />
For e'en then, when the flinty hangman's whips<br />
Were worn with stripes spent on their tender limbs,<br />
I kneel'd, and wept, and begg'd them, though they would<br />
Be cruel to themselves, they would take pity<br />
On my gray hairs; now note a sudden change,<br />
Which I with joy remember; those, whom torture,<br />
Nor fear of death could terrify, were o'ercome<br />
By seeing of my sufferings; and so won,<br />
Returning to the faith that they were born in,<br />
I gave them to the gods. And be assured<br />
I that used justice with a rigorous hand,<br />
Upon such beauteous virgins, and mine own,<br />
Will use no favour, where the cause commands me,<br />
To any other; but, as rocks, be deaf<br />
To all entreaties.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Thou deserv'st thy place;<br />
Still hold it, and with honour. Things thus order'd<br />
Touching the gods, 'tis lawful to descend<br />
To human cares, and exercise that power<br />
Heaven has conferr'd upon me;&mdash;which that you,<br />
Rebels and traitors to the power of Rome,<br />
Should not with all extremities undergo,<br />
What can you urge to qualify your crimes,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Or mitigate my anger?</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><i>K. of Epire.</i> We are now<br />
Slaves to thy power, that yesterday were kings,<br />
And had command o'er others; we confess<br />
Our grandsires paid yours tribute, yet left us,<br />
As their forefathers had, desire of freedom.<br />
And, if you Romans hold it glorious honour,<br />
Not only to defend what is your own,<br />
But to enlarge your empire, (though our fortune<br />
Denies that happiness,) who can accuse<br />
The famish'd mouth, if it attempt to feed?<br />
Or such, whose fetters eat into their freedoms,<br />
If they desire to shake them off?</p>

<p><i>K. of Pontus.</i> We stand<br />
The last examples, to prove how uncertain<br />
All human happiness is; and are prepared<br />
To endure the worst.</p>

<p><i>K. of Macedon.</i> That spoke, which now is highest<br />
In Fortune's wheel, must, when she turns it next,<br />
Decline as low as we are. This consider'd<br />
Taught the &AElig;gyptian Hercules, Sesostris,<br />
That had his chariot drawn by captive kings,<br />
To free them from that slavery;&mdash;but to hope<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Such mercy from a Roman were mere madness:<br />
We are familiar with what cruelty<br />
Rome, since her infant greatness, ever used<br />
Such as she triumph'd over; age nor sex<br />
Exempted from her tyranny; scepter'd princes<br />
Kept in her common dungeons, and their children,<br />
In scorn train'd up in base mechanic arts,<br />
For public bondmen. In the catalogue<br />
Of those unfortunate men, we expect to have<br />
Our names remember'd.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> In all growing empires,<br />
Even cruelty is useful; some must suffer,<br />
And be set up examples to strike terror<br />
In others, though far off: but, when a state<br />
Is raised to her perfection, and her bases<br />
Too firm to shrink, or yield, we may use mercy,<br />
And do 't with safety<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>: but to whom? not cowards,<br />
Or such whose baseness shames the conqueror,<br />
And robs him of his victory, as weak Perseus<br />
Did great &AElig;milius<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. Know, therefore, kings<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Of Epire, Pontus, and of Macedon,<br />
That I with courtesy can use my prisoners,<br />
As well as make them mine by force, provided<br />
That they are noble enemies: such I found you,<br />
Before I made you mine; and, since you were so,<br />
You have not lost the courages of princes,<br />
Although the fortune. Had you born yourselves<br />
Dejectedly, and base, no slavery<br />
Had been too easy for you: but such is<br />
The power of noble valour, that we love it<br />
Even in our enemies, and taken with it,<br />
Desire to make them friends, as I will you.</p>

<p><i>K. of Epire.</i> Mock us not, C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> By the gods, I do not.<br />
Unloose their bonds:&mdash;I now as friends embrace you.<br />
Give them their crowns again.</p>

<p><i>K. of Pontus.</i> We are twice o'ercome;<br />
By courage, and by courtesy.</p>

<p><i>K. of Macedon.</i> But this latter<br />
Shall teach us to live ever faithful vassals<br />
To Dioclesian, and the power of Rome.</p>

<p><i>K of Epire.</i> All kingdoms fall before her!</p>

<p><i>K. of Pontus.</i> And all kings<br />
Contend to honour C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> I believe<br />
Your tongues are the true trumpets of your hearts,<br />
And in it I most happy. Queen of fate,<br />
Imperious Fortune! mix some light disaster<br />
With my so many joys, to season them,<br />
And give them sweeter relish: I'm girt round<br />
With true felicity; faithful subjects here,<br />
Here bold commanders, here with new-made friends:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>But, what's the crown of all, in thee, Artemia,<br />
My only child, whose love to me and duty,<br />
Strive to exceed each other!</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> I make payment<br />
But of a debt, which I stand bound to tender<br />
As a daughter and a subject.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Which requires yet<br />
A retribution from me, Artemia,<br />
Tied by a father's care, how to bestow<br />
A jewel, of all things to me most precious:<br />
Nor will I therefore longer keep thee from<br />
The chief joys of creation, marriage rites;<br />
Which that thou may'st with greater pleasures taste of,<br />
Thou shalt not like with mine eyes, but thine own.<br />
Among these kings, forgetting they were captives;<br />
Or those, remembering not they are my subjects,<br />
Make choice of any: By Jove's dreadful thunder,<br />
My will shall rank with thine.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> It is a bounty<br />
The daughters of great princes seldom meet with;<br />
For they, to make up breaches in the state,<br />
Or for some other public ends, are forced<br />
To match where they affect not<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. May my life<br />
Deserve this favour!</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Speak; I long to know<br />
The man thou wilt make happy.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> If that titles,<br />
Or the adored name of Queen could take me,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Here would I fix mine eyes, and look no further;<br />
But these are baits to take a mean-born lady,<br />
Not her that boldly may call C&aelig;sar father:<br />
In that I can bring honour unto any,<br />
But from no king that lives receive addition:<br />
To raise desert and virtue by my fortune,<br />
Though in a low estate, were greater glory,<br />
Than to mix greatness with a prince that owes<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><br />
No worth but that name only.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> I commend thee;<br />
'Tis like myself.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> If, then, of men beneath me,<br />
My choice is to be made, where shall I seek,<br />
But among those that best deserve from you?<br />
That have served you most faithfully; that in dangers<br />
Have stood next to you; that have interposed<br />
Their breasts as shields of proof, to dull the swords<br />
Aim'd at your bosom; that have spent their blood<br />
To crown your brows with laurel?</p>

<p><i>Macr.</i> Cytherea,<br />
Great Queen of Love, be now propitious to me!</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> [<i>to Sap.</i>] Now mark what I foretold.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Her eye's on me.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Fair Venus' son, draw forth a leaden dart<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>,<br />
And, that she may hate me, transfix her with it;<br />
Or, if thou needs wilt use a golden one,<br />
Shoot it in the behalf of any other:<br />
Thou know'st I am thy votary elsewhere. [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> [<i>advances to Anton.</i>] Sir.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> How he blushes!</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Welcome, fool, thy fortune.<br />
Stand like a block when such an angel courts thee!</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> I am no object to divert your eye<br />
From the beholding.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Rather a bright sun,<br />
Too glorious for him to gaze upon,<br />
That took not first flight from the eagle's aerie.<br />
As I look on the temples, or the gods,<br />
And with that reverence, lady, I behold you,<br />
And shall do ever.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> And it will become you,<br />
While thus we stand at distance; but, if love,<br />
Love born out of the assurance of your virtues,<br />
Teach me to stoop so low&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> O, rather take<br />
A higher flight.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Why, fear you to be raised?<br />
Say I put off the dreadful awe that waits<br />
On majesty, or with you share my beams,<br />
Nay, make you to outshine me; change the name<br />
Of Subject into Lord, rob you of service<br />
That's due from you to me, and in me make it<br />
Duty to honour you, would you refuse me?</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Refuse you, madam! such a worm as I am<br />
Refuse what kings upon their knees would sue for!<br />
Call it, great lady, by another name;<br />
An humble modesty, that would not match<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>A molehill with Olympus.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> He that's famous<br />
For honourable actions in the war,<br />
As you are, Antoninus, a proved soldier,<br />
Is fellow to a king.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> If you love valour,<br />
As 'tis a kingly virtue, seek it out,<br />
And cherish it in a king; there it shines brightest,<br />
And yields the bravest lustre. Look on Epire,<br />
A prince, in whom it is incorporate;<br />
And let it not disgrace him that he was<br />
O'ercome by C&aelig;sar; it was victory,<br />
To stand so long against him: had you seen him,<br />
How in one bloody scene he did discharge<br />
The parts of a commander and a soldier,<br />
Wise in direction, bold in execution;<br />
You would have said, Great C&aelig;sar's self excepted,<br />
The world yields not his equal.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Yet I have heard,<br />
Encountering him alone in the head of his troop,<br />
You took him prisoner.</p>

<p><i>K. of Epire.</i> 'Tis a truth, great princess:<br />
I'll not detract from valour.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> 'Twas mere fortune;<br />
Courage had no hand in it.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Did ever man<br />
Strive so against his own good?</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Spiritless villain!<br />
How I am tortured! By the immortal gods,<br />
I now could kill him.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Hold, Sapritius, hold,<br />
On our displeasure, hold!</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Why, this would make<br />
A father mad; 'tis not to be endured;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Your honour's tainted in 't.</p>

<p>
<i>Sap.</i> By heaven, it is:<br />
I shall think of it.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> 'Tis not to be forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Nay, kneel not, sir; I am no ravisher,<br />
Nor so far gone in fond affection to you,<br />
But that I can retire, my honour safe:&mdash;<br />
Yet say, hereafter, that thou hast neglected<br />
What, but seen in possession of another,<br />
Will make thee mad with envy.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> In her looks<br />
Revenge is written.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> As you love your life,<br />
Study to appease her.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Gracious madam, hear me.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> And be again refused?</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> The tender of<br />
My life, my service, or, since you vouchsafe it,<br />
My love, my heart, my all: and pardon me,<br />
Pardon, dread princess, that I made some scruple<br />
To leave a valley of security,<br />
To mount up to the hill of majesty,<br />
On which, the nearer Jove, the nearer lightning.<br />
What knew I, but your grace made trial of me;<br />
Durst I presume to embrace, where but to touch<br />
With an unmanner'd hand was death? The fox,<br />
When he saw first the forest's king<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, the lion,<br />
Was almost dead with fear; the second view<br />
Only a little daunted him; the third,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>He durst salute him boldly: pray you, apply this;<br />
And you shall find a little time will teach me<br />
To look with more familiar eyes upon you,<br />
Than duty yet allows me.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Well excused.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> You may redeem all yet.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> And, that he may<br />
Have means and opportunity to do so,<br />
Artemia, I leave you my substitute<br />
In fair C&aelig;sarea.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> And here, as yourself,<br />
We will obey and serve her.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Antoninus,<br />
So you prove hers, I wish no other heir;<br />
Think on 't:&mdash;be careful of your charge, Theophilus;<br />
Sapritius, be you my daughter's guardian.<br />
Your company I wish, confederate princes,<br />
In our Dalmatian wars: which finished<br />
With victory I hope, and Maximinus,<br />
Our brother and copartner in the empire,<br />
At my request won to confirm as much,<br />
The kingdoms I took from you we'll restore,<br />
And make you greater than you were before.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Exeunt all but</i></span> <span class="smcap">Antoninus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Macrinus</span>.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Oh, I am lost for ever! lost, Macrinus!<br />
The anchor of the wretched, hope, forsakes me,<br />
And with one blast of Fortune all my light<br />
Of happiness is put out.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> You are like to those<br />
That are ill only, 'cause they are too well;<br />
That, surfeiting in the excess of blessings,<br />
Call their abundance want. What could you wish,<br />
That is not fall'n upon you? honour, greatness,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Respect, wealth, favour, the whole world for a dower;<br />
And with a princess, whose excelling form<br />
Exceeds her fortune.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Yet poison still is poison,<br />
Though drunk in gold; and all these flattering glories<br />
To me, ready to starve, a painted banquet,<br />
And no essential food. When I am scorch'd<br />
With fire, can flames in any other quench me?<br />
What is her love to me, greatness, or empire,<br />
That am slave to another, who alone<br />
Can give me ease or freedom?</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Sir, you point at<br />
Your dotage on the scornful Dorothea:<br />
Is she, though fair, the same day to be named<br />
With best Artemia? In all their courses,<br />
Wise men purpose their ends: with sweet Artemia,<br />
There comes along pleasure, security,<br />
Usher'd by all that in this life is precious:<br />
With Dorothea (though her birth be noble,<br />
The daughter to a senator of Rome,<br />
By him left rich, yet with a private wealth,<br />
And far inferior to yours) arrives<br />
The emperor's frown, which, like a mortal plague,<br />
Speaks death is near; the princess' heavy scorn,<br />
Under which you will shrink; your father's fury,<br />
Which to resist even piety forbids:&mdash;<br />
And but remember that she stands suspected<br />
A favourer of the Christian sect; she brings<br />
Not danger, but assured destruction with her.<br />
This truly weigh'd one smile of great Artemia<br />
Is to be cherish'd, and preferr'd before<br />
All joys in Dorothea: therefore leave her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><i>Anton.</i> In what thou think'st thou art most wise, thou art<br />
Grossly abused, Macrinus, and most foolish.<br />
For any man to match above his rank,<br />
Is but to sell his liberty. With Artemia<br />
I still must live a servant; but enjoying<br />
Divinest Dorothea, I shall rule,<br />
Rule as becomes a husband: for the <i>danger</i>,<br />
Or call it, if you will, <i>assured destruction</i>,<br />
I slight it thus.&mdash;If, then, thou art my friend,<br />
As I dare swear thou art, and wilt not take<br />
A governor's place upon thee<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, be my helper.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> You know I dare, and will do any thing;<br />
Put me unto the test.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Go, then, Macrinus,<br />
To Dorothea; tell her I have worn,<br />
In all the battles I have fought, her figure,<br />
Her figure in my heart, which, like a deity,<br />
Hath still protected me. Thou canst speak well;<br />
And of thy choicest language spare a little,<br />
To make her understand how much I love her,<br />
And how I languish for her. Bear these jewels,<br />
Sent in the way of sacrifice, not service,<br />
As to my goddess: all lets<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> thrown behind me,<br />
Or fears that may deter me, say, this morning<br />
I mean to visit her by the name of friendship:&mdash;<br />
No words to contradict this.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> I am yours:<br />
And, if my travail this way be ill spent,<br />
Judge not my readier will by the event.

<h3>ACT II. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Angelo</span> <i>with a book
and taper</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> My book and taper.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Here, most holy mistress.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Thy voice sends forth such music, that I never<br />
Was ravish'd with a more celestial sound.<br />
Were every servant in the world like thee,<br />
So full of goodness, angels would come down<br />
To dwell with us: thy name is Angelo,<br />
And like that name thou art; get thee to rest,<br />
Thy youth with too much watching is opprest.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> No, my dear lady, I could weary stars,<br />
And force the wakeful moon to lose her eyes,<br />
By my late watching, but to wait on you.<br />
When at your prayers you kneel before the altar,<br />
Methinks I'm singing with some quire in heaven,<br />
So blest I hold me in your company:<br />
Therefore, my most loved mistress, do not bid<br />
Your boy, so serviceable, to get hence;<br />
For then you break his heart.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Be nigh me still, then:<br />
In golden letters down I'll set that day,<br />
Which gave thee to me. Little did I hope<br />
To meet such worlds of comfort in thyself,<br />
This little, pretty body; when I, coming<br />
Forth of the temple, heard my beggar-boy,<br />
My sweet-faced, godly beggar-boy, crave an alms,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Which with glad hand I gave, with lucky hand!&mdash;<br />
And, when I took thee home, my most chaste bosom,<br />
Methought, was fill'd with no hot wanton fire,<br />
But with a holy flame, mounting since higher,<br />
On wings of cherubins, than it did before.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Proud am I, that my lady's modest eye<br />
So likes so poor a servant.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I have offer'd<br />
Handfuls of gold but to behold thy parents.<br />
I would leave kingdoms, were I queen of some,<br />
To dwell with thy good father; for, the son<br />
Bewitching me so deeply with his presence,<br />
He that begot him must do 't ten times more.<br />
I pray thee, my sweet boy, show me thy parents;<br />
Be not ashamed.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> I am not: I did never<br />
Know who my mother was; but, by yon palace,<br />
Fill'd with bright heavenly courtiers, I dare assure you,<br />
And pawn these eyes upon it, and this hand,<br />
My father is in heaven: and, pretty mistress,<br />
If your illustrious hour-glass spend his sand,<br />
No worse than yet it does; upon my life,<br />
You and I both shall meet my father there,<br />
And he shall bid you welcome.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> A blessed day!<br />
We all long to be there, but lose the way.

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Macrinus</span>, <i>met by</i> <span class="smcap">Theophilus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harpax</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><i>Theoph.</i> The Sun, god of the day, guide thee, Macrinus!</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> And thee, Theophilus!</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Glad'st thou in such scorn<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>?<br />
I call my wish back.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> I'm in haste.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> One word,<br />
Take the least hand<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> of time up:&mdash;stay.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Be brief.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> As thought: I prithee tell me, good Macrinus,<br />
How health and our fair princess lay together<br />
This night, for you can tell; courtiers have flies<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>,<br />
That buzz all news unto them.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> She slept but ill.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Double thy courtesy; how does Antoninus?</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Ill, well, straight, crooked,&mdash;I know not how.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Once more;<br />
&mdash;Thy head is full of windmills:&mdash;when doth the princess<br />
Bestow herself on noble Antoninus?</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> I know not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><i>Theoph.</i> No! thou art the manuscript,<br />
Where Antoninus writes down all his secrets:<br />
Honest Macrinus, tell me.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Fare you well, sir.<span style="margin-left:6em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Honesty is some fiend, and frights him hence;<br />
A many courtiers love it not.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> What piece<br />
Of this state-wheel, which winds up Antoninus,<br />
Is broke, it runs so jarringly? the man<br />
Is from himself divided: O thou, the eye,<br />
By which I wonders see, tell me, my Harpax,<br />
What gad-fly tickles this Macrinus so,<br />
That, flinging up the tail, he breaks thus from me.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Oh, sir, his brain-pan is a bed of snakes,<br />
Whose stings shoot through his eye-balls, whose poisonous spawn<br />
Ingenders such a fry of speckled villanies,<br />
That, unless charms more strong than adamant<br />
Be used, the Roman angel's<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> wings shall melt,<br />
And C&aelig;sar's diadem be from his head<br />
Spurn'd by base feet; the laurel which he wears,<br />
Returning victor, be enforced to kiss<br />
That which it hates, the fire. And can this ram,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>This Antoninus-Engine, being made ready<br />
To so much mischief, keep a steady motion?&mdash;<br />
His eyes and feet, you see, give strange assaults.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I'm turn'd a marble statue at thy language,<br />
Which printed is in such crabb'd characters,<br />
It puzzles all my reading: what, in the name<br />
Of Pluto, now is hatching?</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> This Macrinus,<br />
The line is<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, upon which love-errands run<br />
'Twixt Antoninus and that ghost of women,<br />
The bloodless Dorothea; who in prayer<br />
And meditation, mocking all your gods,<br />
Drinks up her ruby colour: yet Antoninus<br />
Plays the Endymion to this pale-faced Moon,<br />
Courts, seeks to catch her eyes&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> And what of this?</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> These are but creeping billows,<br />
Not got to shore yet: but if Dorothea<br />
Fall on his bosom, and be fired with love,<br />
(Your coldest women do so),&mdash;had you ink<br />
Brew'd from the infernal Styx, not all that blackness<br />
Can make a thing so foul, as the dishonours,<br />
Disgraces, buffetings, and most base affronts<br />
Upon the bright Artemia, star o' the court,<br />
Great C&aelig;sar's daughter.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I now conster<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><i>Harp.</i> Nay, more; a firmament of clouds, being fill'd<br />
With Jove's artillery, shot down at once,<br />
To pash<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> your gods in pieces, cannot give,<br />
With all those thunderbolts, so deep a blow<br />
To the religion there, and pagan lore,<br />
As this; for Dorothea hates your gods,<br />
And, if she once blast Antoninus' soul,<br />
Making it foul like hers, Oh! the example&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Eats through C&aelig;sarea's heart like liquid poison.<br />
Have I invented tortures to tear Christians,<br />
To see but which, could all that feel hell's torments<br />
Have leave to stand aloof here on earth's stage,<br />
They would be mad till they again descended,<br />
Holding the pains most horrid of such souls,<br />
May-games to those of mine; has this my hand<br />
Set down a Christian's execution<br />
In such dire postures, that the very hangman<br />
Fell at my foot dead, hearing but their figures;<br />
And shall Macrinus and his fellow-masquer<br />
Strangle me in a dance?</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> No:&mdash;on; I hug thee,<br />
For drilling thy quick brains in this rich plot<br />
Of tortures 'gainst these Christians: on; I hug thee!</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Both hug and holy me: to this Dorothea,<br />
Fly thou and I in thunder.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Not for kingdoms<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Piled upon kingdoms: there's a villain page<br />
Waits on her, whom I would not for the world<br />
Hold traffic with; I do so hate his sight,<br />
That, should I look on him, I must sink down.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I will not lose thee then, her to confound:<br />
None but this head with glories shall be crown'd.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Oh! mine own as I would wish thee!<br />

<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Hall in</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea</span>'<i>s House, with a gallery above</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea, Macrinus</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Angelo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> My trusty Angelo, with that curious eye<br />
Of thine, which ever waits upon my business,<br />
I prithee watch those my still-negligent servants,<br />
That they perform my will, in what's enjoined them<br />
To the good of others. Be careful, my dear boy.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Yes, my sweetest mistress.<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Now, sir, you may go on.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> I then must study<br />
A new arithmetic, to sum up the virtues<br />
Which Antoninus gracefully become.<br />
There is in him so much man, so much goodness,<br />
So much of honour, and of all things else,<br />
Which make our being excellent, that from his store<br />
He can enough lend others; yet, much ta'en from him,<br />
The want shall be as little, as when seas<br />
Lend from their bounty, to fill up the poorness<br />
Of needy rivers.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Sir, he is more indebted<br />
To you for praise, than you to him that owes<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span><i>Mac.</i> If queens, viewing his presents paid to the whiteness<br />
Of your chaste hand alone, should be ambitious<br />
But to be parted<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in their numerous shares;<br />
This he counts nothing: could you see main armies<br />
Make battles in the quarrel of his valour,<br />
That 'tis the best, the truest; this were nothing:<br />
The greatness of his state, his father's voice,<br />
And arm, awing C&aelig;sarea, he ne'er boasts of;<br />
The sunbeams which the emperor throws upon him<br />
Shine there but as in water, and gild him<br />
Not with one spot of pride: no, dearest beauty,<br />
All these, heap'd up together in one scale,<br />
Cannot weigh down the love he bears to you,<br />
Being put into the other.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Could gold buy you<br />
To speak thus for a friend, you, sir, are worthy<br />
Of more than I will number; and this your language<br />
Hath power to win upon another woman,<br />
'Top of whose heart the feathers of this world<br />
Are gaily stuck: but all which first you named,<br />
And now this last, his love, to me are nothing.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> You make me a sad messenger;&mdash;but himself</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Antoninus</span>.</p>

<p>Being come in person, shall, I hope, hear from you<br />
Music more pleasing.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Has your ear, Macrinus,<br />
Heard none, then?</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> None I like.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> But can there be<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>In such a noble casket, wherein lie<br />
Beauty and chastity in their full perfections,<br />
A rocky heart, killing with cruelty<br />
A life that's prostrated beneath your feet?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I am guilty of a shame I yet ne'er knew,<br />
Thus to hold parley with you;&mdash;pray, sir, pardon.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">[<i>Going.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Good sweetness, you now have it, and shall go:<br />
Be but so merciful, before your wounding me<br />
With such a mortal weapon as Farewell,<br />
To let me murmur to your virgin ear,<br />
What I was loth to lay on any tongue<br />
But this mine own.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> If one immodest accent<br />
Fly out, I hate you everlastingly.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> My true love dares not do it.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Hermes inspire thee!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter, in the gallery above</i>, <span class="smcap">Artemia</span>, <span class="smcap">Sapritius</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Theophilus</span>.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Come, let me tune you:&mdash;glaze not thus your eyes<br />
With self-love of a vow'd virginity;<br />
All men desire your sweet society,<br />
But if you bar me from it, you do kill me,<br />
And of my blood are guilty.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> O base villain!</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Bridle your rage, sweet princess.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Could not my fortunes,<br />
Rear'd higher far than yours, be worthy of you,<br />
Methinks my dear affection makes you mine.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Sir, for your fortunes, were they mines of gold,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>He that I love is richer; and for worth,<br />
You are to him lower than any slave<br />
Is to a monarch.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> So insolent, base Christian!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Can I, with wearing out my knees before him,<br />
Get you but be his servant, you shall boast<br />
You're equal to a king.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Confusion on thee,<br />
For playing thus the lying sorceress!</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Your mocks are great ones; none beneath the sun<br />
Will I be servant to.&mdash;On my knees I beg it,<br />
Pity me, wondrous maid.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> I curse thy baseness.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Listen to more.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> O kneel not, sir, to me.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> This knee is emblem of an humbled heart:<br />
That heart which tortured is with your disdain,<br />
Justly for scorning others, even this heart,<br />
To which for pity such a princess sues,<br />
As in her hand offers me all the world,<br />
Great C&aelig;sar's daughter.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Slave, thou liest.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Yet this<br />
Is adamant to her, that melts to you<br />
In drops of blood.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> A very dog!</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Perhaps<br />
'Tis my religion makes you knit the brow;<br />
Yet be you mine, and ever be your own:<br />
I ne'er will screw your conscience from that Power,<br />
On which you Christians lean.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> I can no longer<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>Fret out my life with weeping at thee, villain.<br />
Sirrah!<span style="margin-left: 11em;">[<i>Aloud.</i></span><br />
Would, ere thy birth, the mighty Thunderer's hand<br />
Had struck thee in the womb!</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> We are betray'd.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Is that the idol, traitor, which thou kneel'st to,<br />
Trampling upon my beauty?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Sirrah, bandog<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>!<br />
Wilt thou in pieces tear our Jupiter<br />
For her? our Mars for her? our Sol for her?</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Threaten not, but strike: quick vengeance flies<br />
Into my bosom; caitiff! here all love dies.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Exeunt above.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><i>Anton.</i> O! I am thunderstruck! We are both o'erwhelm'd&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> With one high-raging billow.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> You a soldier,<br />
And sink beneath the violence of a woman!</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> A woman! a wrong'd princess. From such a star<br />
Blazing with fires of hate, what can be look'd for,<br />
But tragical events? my life is now<br />
The subject of her tyranny.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> That fear is base,<br />
Of death, when that death doth but life displace<br />
Out of her house of earth; you only dread<br />
The stroke, and not what follows when you're dead;<br />
There's the great fear, indeed: come, let your eyes<br />
Dwell where mine do, you'll scorn their tyrannies.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter below</i>, <span class="smcap">Artemia, Sapritius, Theophilus</span>,
<i>a guard</i>; <span class="smcap">Angelo</span> <i>comes and stands close
by</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea</span>.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> My father's nerves put vigour in mine arm,<br />
And I his strength must use. Because I once<br />
Shed beams of favour on thee, and, with the lion,<br />
Play'd with thee gently, when thou struck'st my heart,<br />
I'll not insult on a base, humbled prey,<br />
By lingering out thy terrors; but, with one frown,<br />
Kill thee:&mdash;hence with them all to execution.<br />
Seize him; but let even death itself be weary<br />
In torturing her. I'll change those smiles to shrieks;<br />
Give the fool what she's proud of, martyrdom:<br />
In pieces rack that pander.<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Points to</i></span> <span class="smcap">Macr.</span></p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Albeit the reverence<br />
I owe our gods and you, are, in my bosom,<br />
Torrents so strong, that pity quite lies drown'd<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>From saving this young man; yet, when I see<br />
What face death gives him, and that a thing within me<br />
Says, 'tis my son, I am forced to be a man,<br />
And grow fond of his life, which thus I beg.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> And I deny.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Sir, you dishonour me,<br />
To sue for that which I disclaim to have.<br />
I shall more glory in my sufferings gain,<br />
Than you in giving judgment, since I offer<br />
My blood up to your anger; nor do I kneel<br />
To keep a wretched life of mine from ruin:<br />
Preserve this temple, builded fair as yours is,<br />
And C&aelig;sar never went in greater triumph,<br />
Than I shall to the scaffold.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Are you so brave, sir?<br />
Set forward to his triumph, and let those two<br />
Go cursing along with him.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No, but pitying,<br />
For my part, I, that you lose ten times more<br />
By torturing me, than I that dare your tortures:<br />
Through all the army of my sins, I have even<br />
Labour'd to break, and cope with death to the face.<br />
The visage of a hangman frights not me;<br />
The sight of whips, racks, gibbets, axes, fires,<br />
Are scaffoldings by which my soul climbs up<br />
To an eternal habitation.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> C&aelig;sar's imperial daughter, hear me speak.<br />
Let not this Christian thing in this her pageantry<br />
Of proud deriding both our gods and C&aelig;sar,<br />
Build to herself a kingdom in her death,<br />
Going laughing from us: no; her bitterest torment<br />
Shall be, to feel her constancy beaten down;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>The bravery of her resolution lie<br />
Batter'd, by argument, into such pieces,<br />
That she again in penitence shall creep<br />
To kiss the pavements of our paynim gods.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> How to be done?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I'll send my daughters to her,<br />
And they shall turn her rocky faith to wax;<br />
Else spit at me, let me be made your slave,<br />
And meet no Roman's but a villain's grave.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Thy prisoner let her be, then; and, Sapritius,<br />
Your son and that<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, be yours: death shall be sent<br />
To him that suffers them, by voice or letters,<br />
To greet each other. Rifle her estate;<br />
Christians to beggary brought grow desperate.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Still on the bread of poverty let me feed.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> O! my admired mistress, quench not out<br />
The holy fires within you, though temptations<br />
Shower down upon you: Clasp thine armour on,<br />
Fight well, and thou shalt see, after these wars,<br />
Thy head wear sunbeams, and thy feet touch stars.<br />

<h3>ACT III. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sapritius, Theophilus</span>, <i>Priest</i>, <span class="smcap">Calista</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Christeta</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Sick to the death, I fear.</p>

<p><i>Theoph</i>. I meet your sorrow,<br />
With my true feeling of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span><i>Sap.</i> She's a witch,<br />
A sorceress, Theophilus; my son<br />
Is charm'd by her enchanting eyes; and, like<br />
An image made of wax, her beams of beauty<br />
Melt him to nothing: all my hopes in him,<br />
And all his gotten honours, find their grave<br />
In his strange dotage on her. Would, when first<br />
He saw and loved her, that the earth had open'd,<br />
And swallow'd both alive!</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> There's hope left yet.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Not any: though the princess were appeased,<br />
All title in her love surrender'd up;<br />
Yet this coy Christian is so transported<br />
With her religion, that unless my son<br />
(But let him perish first!) drink the same potion,<br />
And be of her belief, she'll not vouchsafe<br />
To be his lawful wife.</p>

<p><i>Priest.</i> But, once removed<br />
From her opinion, as I rest assured<br />
The reasons of these holy maids will win her,<br />
You'll find her tractable to any thing,<br />
For your content or his.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> If she refuse it,<br />
The Stygian damps, breeding infectious airs,<br />
The mandrake's shrieks, the basilisk's killing eye,<br />
The dreadful lightning that does crush the bones,<br />
And never singe the skin, shall not appear<br />
Less fatal to her, than my zeal made hot<br />
With love unto my gods. I have deferr'd it,<br />
In hopes to draw back this apostata,<br />
Which will be greater honour than her death,<br />
Unto her father's faith; and, to that end,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>Have brought my daughters hither.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> And we doubt not<br />
To do what you desire.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Let her be sent for.<br />
Prosper in your good work; and were I not<br />
To attend the princess, I would see and hear<br />
How you succeed.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I am commanded too,<br />
I'll bear you company.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Give them your ring,<br />
To lead her as in triumph, if they win her,<br />
Before her highness.<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Spare no promises,<br />
Persuasions, or threats, I do conjure you:<br />
If you prevail, 'tis the most glorious work<br />
You ever undertook.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Angelo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Priest.</i> She comes.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> We leave you;<br />
Be constant, and be careful.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">[<i>Exeunt</i></span> <span class="smcap">Theoph.</span> <i>and Priest</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> We are sorry<br />
To meet you under guard.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But I more grieved<br />
You are at liberty. So well I love you,<br />
That I could wish, for such a cause as mine,<br />
You were my fellow-prisoners: Prithee, Angelo,<br />
Reach us some chairs. Please you sit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> We thank you:<br />
Our visit is for love, love to your safety.</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> Our conference must be private; pray you, therefore,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Command your boy to leave us.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> You may trust him<br />
With any secret that concerns my life;<br />
Falsehood and he are strangers: had you, ladies,<br />
Been bless'd with such a servant, you had never<br />
Forsook that way, your journey even half ended,<br />
That leads to joys eternal. In the place<br />
Of loose lascivious mirth, he would have stirr'd you<br />
To holy meditations; and so far<br />
He is from flattery, that he would have told you,<br />
Your pride being at the height, how miserable<br />
And wretched things you were, that, for an hour<br />
Of pleasure here, have made a desperate sale<br />
Of all your right in happiness hereafter.<br />
He must not leave me; without him I fall:<br />
In this life he's my servant, in the other<br />
A wish'd companion.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> 'Tis not in the devil,<br />
Nor all his wicked arts, to shake such goodness.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But you were speaking, lady.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> As a friend<br />
And lover of your safety, and I pray you<br />
So to receive it; and, if you remember<br />
How near in love our parents were, that we,<br />
Even from the cradle, were brought up together,<br />
Our amity increasing with our years,<br />
We cannot stand suspected.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> To the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> We come, then, as good angels, Dorothea,<br />
To make you happy; and the means so easy,<br />
That, be not you an enemy to yourself,<br />
Already you enjoy it.</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> Look on us,<br />
Ruin'd as you are, once, and brought unto it,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>By your persuasion.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> But what follow'd, lady?<br />
Leaving those blessings which our gods gave freely,<br />
And shower'd upon us with a prodigal hand,<br />
As to be noble born, youth, beauty, wealth,<br />
And the free use of these without control,<br />
Check, curb, or stop, such is our law's indulgence!<br />
All happiness forsook us; bonds and fetters,<br />
For amorous twines; the rack and hangman's whips,<br />
In place of choice delights; our parents' curses<br />
Instead of blessings; scorn, neglect, contempt,<br />
Fell thick upon us.</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> This consider'd wisely,<br />
We made a fair retreat; and reconciled<br />
To our forsaken gods, we live again<br />
In all prosperity.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> By our example,<br />
Bequeathing misery to such as love it,<br />
Learn to be happy. The Christian yoke's too heavy<br />
For such a dainty neck; it was framed rather<br />
To be the shrine of Venus, or a pillar,<br />
More precious than crystal, to support<br />
Our Cupid's image: our religion, lady,<br />
Is but a varied pleasure; yours a toil<br />
Slaves would shrink under.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Have you not cloven feet? are you not devils?<br />
Dare any say so much, or dare I hear it<br />
Without a virtuous and religious anger?<br />
Now to put on a virgin modesty,<br />
Or maiden silence, when His power is question'd<br />
That is omnipotent, were a greater crime,<br />
Than in a bad cause to be impudent.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Your gods! your temples! brothel-houses rather,<br />
Or wicked actions of the worst of men,<br />
Pursued and practised. Your religious rites!<br />
Oh! call them rather juggling mysteries,<br />
The baits and nets of hell: your souls the prey<br />
For which the devil angles; your false pleasures<br />
A steep descent, by which you headlong fall<br />
Into eternal torments.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Do not tempt<br />
Our powerful gods.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Which of your powerful gods?<br />
Your gold, your silver, brass, or wooden ones,<br />
That can nor do me hurt, nor protect you?<br />
Most pitied women! will you sacrifice<br />
To such,&mdash;or call them gods or goddesses,<br />
Your parents would disdain to be the same,<br />
Or you yourselves? O blinded ignorance!<br />
Tell me, Calista, by thy truth, I charge you,<br />
Or any thing you hold more dear, would you,<br />
To have him deified to posterity,<br />
Desire your father an adulterer,<br />
A ravisher, almost a parricide,<br />
A vile incestuous wretch?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> That, piety<br />
And duty answer for me.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Or you, Christeta,<br />
To be hereafter register'd a goddess,<br />
Give your chaste body up to the embraces<br />
Of wicked passion? have it writ on your forehead,<br />
"This is the mistress in the art of sin.<br />
Knows every trick, and labyrinth of desires<br />
That are immodest?"</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> You judge better of me,<br />
Or my affection is ill placed on you.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>Shall I turn wanton?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No, I think you would not.<br />
Yet, such was Venus, whom you worship; such<br />
Flora, the foundress of the public stews,<br />
And has, for that, her sacrifice; your Jupiter,<br />
A loose adulterer:&mdash;read ye but those<br />
That have canonized them, you'll find them worse<br />
Than, in chaste language, I can speak them to you.<br />
Are they immortal, then, that did partake<br />
Of human weakness, and had ample share<br />
In men's most base affections; subject to<br />
Unchaste loves, anger, bondage, wounds, as men are?<br />
Here, Jupiter, to serve his lust, turn'd bull,<br />
The shape, indeed, in which he stole Europa;<br />
Neptune, for gain, builds up the walls of Troy,<br />
As a day-labourer; Apollo keeps<br />
Admetus' sheep for bread; the Lemnian smith<br />
Sweats at the forge for hire; Prometheus here,<br />
With his still-growing liver, feeds the vulture;<br />
Saturn bound fast in hell with adamant chains;<br />
And thousands more, on whom abused error<br />
Bestows a deity. Will you then, dear sisters,<br />
For I would have you such, pay your devotions<br />
To things of less power than yourselves?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> We worship<br />
Their good deeds in their images.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> By whom fashion'd?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>By sinful men. I'll tell you a short tale<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,<br />
Nor can you but confess it is a true one:<br />
A king of Egypt, being to erect<br />
The image of Osiris, whom they honour,<br />
Took from the matrons' necks the richest jewels,<br />
And purest gold, as the materials<br />
To finish up his work; which perfected,<br />
With all solemnity he set it up,<br />
To be adored, and served himself his idol;<br />
Desiring it to give him victory<br />
Against his enemies: but, being overthrown,<br />
Enraged against his god, (these are fine gods,<br />
Subject to human fury!) he took down<br />
The senseless thing, and melting it again,<br />
He made a bason, in which eunuchs wash'd<br />
His concubine's feet; and for this sordid use,<br />
Some months it served: his mistress proving false,<br />
As most indeed do so, and grace concluded<br />
Between him and the priests, of the same bason<br />
He made his god again!&mdash;Think, think, of this,<br />
And then consider, if all worldly honours,<br />
Or pleasures that do leave sharp stings behind them,<br />
Have power to win such as have reasonable souls,<br />
To put their trust in dross.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Oh, that I had been born<br />
Without a father!</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> Piety to him<br />
Hath ruin'd us for ever.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Think not so;<br />
You may repair all yet: the attribute<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>That speaks his Godhead most, is merciful:<br />
Revenge is proper to the fiends you worship,<br />
Yet cannot strike without his leave.&mdash;You weep,&mdash;<br />
Oh, 'tis a heavenly shower! celestial balm<br />
To cure your wounded conscience! let it fall,<br />
Fall thick upon it; and, when that is spent,<br />
I'll help it with another of my tears:<br />
And may your true repentance prove the child<br />
Of my true sorrow, never mother had<br />
A birth so happy!</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> We are caught ourselves,<br />
That came to take you; and, assured of conquest,<br />
We are your captives.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And in that you triumph:<br />
Your victory had been eternal loss,<br />
And this your loss immortal gain. Fix here,<br />
And you shall feel yourselves inwardly arm'd<br />
'Gainst tortures, death, and hell:&mdash;but, take heed, sisters,<br />
That, or through weakness, threats, or mild persuasions,<br />
Though of a father, you fall not into<br />
A second and a worse apostasy.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Never, oh never! steel'd by your example,<br />
We dare the worst of tyranny.</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> Here's our warrant,<br />
You shall along and witness it.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Be confirm'd then;<br />
And rest assured, the more you suffer here,<br />
The more your glory, you to heaven more dear.<br />

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Governor's</span> <i>Palace</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Artemia, Sapritius, Theophilus</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harpax</span>.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Sapritius, though your son deserve no pity,<br />
We grieve his sickness: his contempt of us<br />
We cast behind us, and look back upon<br />
His service done to C&aelig;sar, that weighs down<br />
Our just displeasure. If his malady<br />
Have growth from his restraint, or that you think<br />
His liberty can cure him, let him have it:<br />
Say, we forgive him freely.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Your grace binds us<br />
Ever your humblest vassals.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Use all means<br />
For his recovery; though yet I love him,<br />
I will not force affection. If the Christian,<br />
Whose beauty hath out-rivall'd me, be won<br />
To be of our belief, then let him wed her;<br />
That all may know, when the cause wills, I can<br />
Command my own affections.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Be happy then,<br />
My lord Sapritius: I am confident,<br />
Such eloquence and sweet persuasion dwell<br />
Upon my daughters' tongues, that they will work her<br />
To any thing they please.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> I wish they may!<br />
Yet 'tis no easy task to undertake,<br />
To alter a perverse and obstinate woman.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">[<i>A shout within: loud music.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> What means this shout?</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> It is seconded with music,<br />
Triumphant music.&mdash;Ha!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sempronius</span>.</p>

<p><i>Semp.</i> My lord, your daughters,<br />
The pillars of our faith<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, having converted,<br />
For so report gives out, the Christian lady,<br />
The image of great Jupiter born before them,<br />
Sue for access.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> My soul divined as much.<br />
Blest be the time when first they saw this light!<br />
Their mother, when she bore them to support<br />
My feeble age, fill'd not my longing heart<br />
With so much joy, as they in this good work<br />
Have thrown upon me.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter priest with the Image of Jupiter, incense
and censers: followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Calista</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Christeta</span>,
<i>leading</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea</span>.</p>

<p>Welcome, oh, thrice welcome,<br />
Daughters, both of my body and my mind!<br />
Let me embrace in you my bliss, my comfort;<br />
And, Dorothea, now more welcome too,<br />
Than if you never had fallen off! I am ravish'd<br />
With the excess of joy:&mdash;speak, happy daughters,<br />
The blest event.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> We never gain'd so much<br />
By any undertaking.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> O my dear girl,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>Our gods reward thee!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nor was ever time,<br />
On my part, better spent.</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> We are all now<br />
Of one opinion.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> My best Christeta!<br />
Madam, if ever you did grace to worth,<br />
Vouchsafe your princely hands.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Most willingly&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Do you refuse it?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Let us first deserve it.</p>

<p>
<i>Theoph.</i> My own child still! here set our god; prepare<br />
The incense quickly: Come, fair Dorothea,<br />
I will myself support you;&mdash;now kneel down,<br />
And pay your vows to Jupiter.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I shall do it<br />
Better by their example.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> They shall guide you;<br />
They are familiar with the sacrifice.<br />
Forward, my twins of comfort, and, to teach her,<br />
Make a joint offering.</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> Thus&mdash;&mdash; [<i>they both spit at the image.</i></p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> And thus&mdash;&mdash; [<i>throw it down, and spurn it.</i></p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Profane,<br />
And impious! stand you now like a statue?<br />
Are you the champion of the gods? where is<br />
Your holy zeal, your anger?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I am blasted;<br />
And, as my feet were rooted here, I find<br />
I have no motion; I would I had no sight too!<br />
Or if my eyes can serve to any use,<br />
Give me, thou injured power! a sea of tears,<br />
To expiate this madness in my daughters;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>For, being themselves, they would have trembled at<br />
So blasphemous a deed in any other:&mdash;&mdash;<br />
For my sake, hold awhile thy dreadful thunder,<br />
And give me patience to demand a reason<br />
For this accursed act.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> 'Twas bravely done.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Peace, damn'd enchantress, peace!&mdash;I should look on you<br />
With eyes made red with fury, and my hand,<br />
That shakes with rage, should much outstrip my tongue,<br />
And seal my vengeance on your hearts;&mdash;but nature,<br />
To you that have fallen once, bids me again<br />
To be a father. Oh! how durst you tempt<br />
The anger of great Jove?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Alack, poor Jove!<br />
He is no swaggerer; how still he stands!<br />
He'll take a kick, or any thing.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Stop her mouth.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> It is the patient'st godling! do not fear him;<br />
He would not hurt the thief that stole away<br />
Two of his golden locks; indeed he could not:<br />
And still 'tis the same quiet thing.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Blasphemer!<br />
Ingenious cruelty shall punish this:<br />
Thou art past hope: but for you yet, dear daughters,<br />
Again bewitch'd, the dew of mild forgiveness<br />
May gently fall, provided you deserve it,<br />
With true contrition: be yourselves again;<br />
Sue to the offended deity.</p>

<p><i>Christ.</i> Not to be<br />
The mistress of the earth.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> I will not offer<br />
A grain of incense to it, much less kneel,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>Nor look on it but with contempt and scorn,<br />
To have a thousand years conferr'd upon me<br />
Of worldly blessings. We profess ourselves<br />
To be, like Dorothea, Christians;<br />
And owe her for that happiness.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> My ears<br />
Receive, in hearing this, all deadly charms,<br />
Powerful to make man wretched.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Are these they<br />
You bragg'd could convert others!</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> That want strength<br />
To stand themselves!</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> Your honour is engaged,<br />
The credit of your cause depends upon it;<br />
Something you must do suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> And I will.</p>

<p><i>Harp.</i> They merit death; but, falling by your hand,<br />
'Twill be recorded for a just revenge,<br />
And holy fury in you.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Do not blow<br />
The furnace of a wrath thrice hot already;<br />
&AElig;tna is in my breast, wildfire burns here,<br />
Which only blood must quench. Incensed Power!<br />
Which from my infancy I have adored,<br />
Look down with favourable beams upon<br />
The sacrifice, though not allow'd thy priest,<br />
Which I will offer to thee; and be pleased,<br />
My fiery zeal inciting me to act,<br />
To call that justice others may style murder.<br />
Come, you accursed, thus by the hair I drag you<br />
Before this holy altar; thus look on you,<br />
Less pitiful than tigers to their prey:<br />
And thus, with mine own hand, I take that life<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Which I gave to you.
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Kills them.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> O most cruel butcher!</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> My anger ends not here: hell's dreadful porter,<br />
Receive into thy ever-open gates<br />
Their damned souls, and let the Furies' whips<br />
On them alone be wasted; and, when death<br />
Closes these eyes, 'twill be Elysium to me<br />
To hear their shrieks and howlings. Make me, Pluto,<br />
Thy instrument to furnish thee with souls<br />
Of that accursed sect; nor let me fall,<br />
Till my fell vengeance hath consumed them all.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">[<i>Exit, with</i></span> <span class="smcap">Harpax</span>.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> 'Tis a brave zeal.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, call him back again,<br />
Call back your hangman! here's one prisoner left<br />
To be the subject of his knife.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Not so;<br />
We are not so near reconciled unto thee;<br />
Thou shalt not perish such an easy way.<br />
Be she your charge, Sapritius, now; and suffer<br />
None to come near her, till we have found out<br />
Some torments worthy of her.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Courage, mistress;<br />
These martyrs but prepare your glorious fate:<br />
You shall exceed them, and not imitate.

<h3>ACT IV. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Governor's Palace.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Antoninus</span> <i>on a couch, asleep, with Doctors about
him</i>; <span class="smcap">Sapritius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Macrinus</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> O you, that are half gods, lengthen that life<br />
Their deities lend us; turn o'er all the volumes<br />
Of your mysterious &AElig;sculapian science,<br />
T' increase the number of this young man's days:<br />
And, for each minute of his time prolong'd,<br />
Your fee shall be a piece of Roman gold<br />
With C&aelig;sar's stamp, such as he sends his captains<br />
When in the wars they earn well: do but save him,<br />
And, as he's half myself, be you all mine.</p>

<p><i>1 Doct.</i> What art can do, we promise; physic's hand<br />
As apt is to destroy as to preserve,<br />
If heaven make not the med'cine: all this while,<br />
Our skill hath combat held with his disease;<br />
But 'tis so arm'd, and a deep melancholy,<br />
To be such in part with death, we are in fear<br />
The grave must mock our labours.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> I have been<br />

<p class="center"><i>The Place of Execution. A scaffold, block, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Antoninus</span>, <i>supported by</i> <span class="smcap">Macrinus</span>, <i>and
Servants</i>.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Is this the place, where virtue is to suffer,<br />
And heavenly beauty, leaving this base earth,<br />
To make a glad return from whence it came?<br />
Is it, Macrinus?</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> By this preparation,<br />
You well may rest assured that Dorothea<br />
This hour is to die here.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Then with her dies<br />
The abstract of all sweetness that's in woman!<br />
Set me down, friend, that, ere the iron hand<br />
Of death close up mine eyes, they may at once<br />
Take my last leave both of this light and her:<br />
For, she being gone, the glorious sun himself<br />
To me's Cimmerian darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><i>Mac.</i> Strange affection<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>!<br />
Cupid once more hath changed his shafts with Death,<br />
And kills, instead of giving life.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Nay, weep not;<br />
Though tears of friendship be a sovereign balm,<br />
On me they're cast away. It is decreed<br />
That I must die with her; our clue of life<br />
Was spun together.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Yet, sir, 'tis my wonder,<br />
That you, who, hearing only what she suffers,<br />
Partake of all her tortures, yet will be,<br />
To add to your calamity, an eyewitness<br />
Of her last tragic scene, which must pierce deeper,<br />
And make the wound more desperate.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Oh, Macrinus!<br />
'Twould linger out my torments else, not kill me,<br />
Which is the end I aim at: being to die too,<br />
What instrument more glorious can I wish for,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Than what is made sharp by my constant love<br />
And true affection? It may be, the duty<br />
And loyal service, with which I pursued her,<br />
And seal'd it with my death, will be remember'd<br />
Among her blessed actions; and what honour<br />
Can I desire beyond it?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a Guard bringing in</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothea</span>, <i>a Headsman
before her; followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Theophilus, Sapritius</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Harpax</span>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em;">See, she comes;</span><br />
How sweet her innocence appears! more like<br />
To heaven itself, than any sacrifice<br />
That can be offer'd to it. By my hopes<br />
Of joys hereafter, the sight makes me doubtful<br />
In my belief; nor can I think our gods<br />
Are good, or to be served, that take delight<br />
In offerings of this kind: that, to maintain<br />
Their power, deface the master-piece of nature,<br />
Which they themselves come short of. She ascends,<br />
And every step raises her nearer heaven.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> You are to blame<br />
To let him come abroad.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> It was his will;<br />
And we were left to serve him, not command him.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> Good sir, be not offended; nor deny<br />
My last of pleasures in this happy object,<br />
That I shall e'er be blest with.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Now, proud contemner<br />
Of us, and of our gods, tremble to think,<br />
It is not in the Power thou serv'st to save thee.<br />
Not all the riches of the sea, increased<br />
By violent shipwrecks, nor the unsearch'd mines,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>(Mammon's unknown exchequer), shall redeem thee:<br />
And, therefore, having first with horror weigh'd<br />
What 'tis to die, and to die young; to part with<br />
All pleasures and delights; lastly, to go<br />
Where all antipathies to comfort dwell,<br />
Furies behind, about thee, and before thee;<br />
And, to add to affliction, the remembrance<br />
Of the Elysian joys thou might'st have tasted,<br />
Hadst thou not turn'd apostata<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to those gods<br />
That so reward their servants; let despair<br />
Prevent the hangman's sword, and on this scaffold<br />
Make thy first entrance into hell.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> She smiles,<br />
Unmoved, by Mars! as if she were assured<br />
Death, looking on her constancy, would forget<br />
The use of his inevitable hand.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Derided too! despatch, I say.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Thou fool!<br />
That gloriest in having power to ravish<br />
A trifle from me I am weary of,<br />
What is this life to me? not worth a thought;<br />
Or, if it be esteem'd, 'tis that I lose it<br />
To win a better: even thy malice serves<br />
To me but as a ladder to mount up<br />
To such a height of happiness, where I shall<br />
Look down with scorn on thee, and on the world;<br />
Where, circled with true pleasures, placed above<br />
The reach of death or time, 'twill be my glory<br />
To think at what an easy price I bought it.<br />
There's a perpetual spring, perpetual youth:<br />
No joint-benumbing cold, or scorching heat,<br />
Famine, nor age, have any being there.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>Forget, for shame, your Tempe; bury in<br />
Oblivion your feign'd Hesperian orchards:&mdash;<br />

Which did require a Hercules to get<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> it,<br />
Compared with what grows in all plenty there,<br />
Deserves not to be named. The Power I serve<br />
Laughs at your happy Araby, or the<br />
Elysian shades; for he hath made his bowers<br />
Better in deed, than you can fancy yours.</p>

<p><i>Anton.</i> O, take me thither with you!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Trace my steps,<br />
And be assured you shall.</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> With my own hands<br />
I'll rather stop that little breath is left thee,<br />
And rob thy killing fever.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> By no means;<br />
Let him go with her: do, seduced young man,<br />
And wait upon thy saint in death; do, do:<br />
And, when you come to that imagined place,<br />
That place of all delights&mdash;pray you, observe me,<br />
And meet those cursed things I once call'd Daughters,<br />
Whom I have sent as harbingers before you;<br />

In thankfulness to me, that with care hasten<br />
Your journey thither, pray you send me some<br />

<p><i>Sap.</i> Wilt thou in thy last minute damn thyself?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> The gates to hell are open.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Thou glorious minister of the Power I serve!<br />
(For thou art more than mortal,) is 't for me,<br />

Thy heavenly habitation, and vouchsafest,<br />
Though glorified, to take my servant's habit?&mdash;<br />
For, put off thy divinity, so look'd<br />
My lovely Angelo.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Know, I am the same;<br />
And still the servant to your piety.<br />
Your zealous prayers and pious deeds first won me<br />
(But 'twas by His command to whom you sent them)<br />
To guide your steps. I tried your charity,<br />
When in a beggar's shape you took me up,<br />
And clothed my naked limbs, and after fed,<br />
As you believed, my famish'd mouth. Learn all,<br />
By your example, to look on the poor<br />
With gentle eyes! for in such habits, often,<br />
Angels desire an alms<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. I never left you,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Nor will I now; for I am sent to carry<br />
Your pure and innocent soul to joys eternal,<br />
Your martyrdom once suffer'd; and before it,<br />
Ask any thing from me, and rest assured,<br />
You shall obtain it.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I am largely paid<br />
For all my torments. Since I find such grace,<br />
Grant that the love of this young man to me,<br />
In which he languisheth to death, may be<br />
Changed to the love of heaven.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> I will perform it;<br />
And in that instant when the sword sets free<br />
Your happy soul, his shall have liberty.<br />
Is there aught else?</p>

My persecutor, who in scorn desired<br />
To taste of that most sacred fruit I go to;<br />
After my death, as sent from me, be pleased<br />

A shape angelical. Mine eyes, though dazzled,<br />

A pair of glorious wings; yes, they were wings;<br />
And hence he flew:&mdash;&mdash;'tis vanish'd! Jupiter,<br />
For all my sacrifices done to him,<br />
Never once gave me smile.&mdash;How can stone smile?<br />
Or wooden image laugh? [<i>music.</i>] Ha! I remember,<br />
Such music gave a welcome to mine ear,<br />
When the fair youth came to me:&mdash;'tis in the air,<br />

And makes me see a conscience all stain'd o'er,<br />

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dioclesian</span>'<i>s Palace</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dioclesian, Maximinus</span>, <i>the Kings of Epire,
Pontus, and Macedon, meeting</i> <span class="smcap">Artemia</span>; <i>Attendants</i>.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Glory and conquest still attend upon<br />
Triumphant C&aelig;sar!</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Let thy wish, fair daughter,<br />
Be equally divided; and hereafter<br />
Learn thou to know and reverence Maximinus,<br />
Whose power, with mine united, makes one C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p><i>Max.</i> But that I fear 'twould be held flattery,<br />
The bonds consider'd in which we stand tied,<br />
As love and empire, I should say, till now<br />
I ne'er had seen a lady I thought worthy<br />
To be my mistress.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Sir, you show yourself<br />
Both courtier and soldier; but take heed,<br />
Take heed, my lord, though my dull-pointed beauty,<br />
Stain'd by a harsh refusal in my servant,<br />
Cannot dart forth such beams as may inflame you,<br />
You may encounter such a powerful one,<br />
That with a pleasing heat will thaw your heart,<br />
Though bound in ribs of ice. Love still is Love;<br />
His bow and arrows are the same: Great Julius,<br />
That to his successors left the name of C&aelig;sar,<br />
Whom war could never tame, that with dry eyes<br />
Beheld the large plains of Pharsalia cover'd<br />
With the dead carcases of senators,<br />
And citizens of Rome; when the world knew<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>No other lord but him, struck deep in years too,<br />
(And men gray-hair'd forget the loves of youth,)<br />
After all this, meeting fair Cleopatra,<br />
A suppliant too, the magic of her eye,<br />
Even in his pride of conquest, took him captive:<br />
Nor are you more secure.</p>

<p><i>Max.</i> Were you deform'd,<br />
(But, by the gods, you are most excellent,)<br />
Your gravity and discretion would o'ercome me;<br />
And I should be more proud in being prisoner<br />
To your fair virtues, than of all the honours,<br />
Wealth, title, empire, that my sword hath purchased.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> This meets my wishes. Welcome it, Artemia,<br />
With outstretch'd arms, and study to forget<br />
That Antoninus ever was: thy fate<br />
Reserved thee for this better choice; embrace it.</p>

<p><i>Max.</i> This happy match brings new nerves to give strength<br />
To our continued league.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Hymen himself<br />
Will bless this marriage, which we'll solemnize<br />
In the presence of these kings.</p>

<p><i>K. of Pontus.</i> Who rest most happy,<br />
To be eye-witnesses of a match that brings<br />
Peace to the empire.</p>

<p>Diocle. We much thank your loves:<br />
But where's Sapritius, our governor,<br />
And our most zealous provost, good Theophilus?<br />
If ever prince were blest in a true servant,<br />
Or could the gods be debtors to a man,<br />
Both they and we stand far engaged to cherish<br />
His piety and service.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> Sir, the governor<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>Brooks sadly his son's loss, although he turn'd<br />
Apostata in death; but bold Theophilus,<br />
Who for the same cause, in my presence, seal'd<br />
His holy anger on his daughters' hearts;<br />
Having with tortures first tried to convert her,<br />
Dragg'd the bewitching Christian to the scaffold,<br />
And saw her lose her head.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> He is all worthy:<br />
And from his own mouth I would gladly hear<br />
The manner how she suffer'd.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> 'Twill be deliver'd<br />
With such contempt and scorn, (I know his nature,)<br />
That rather 'twill beget your highness' laughter,<br />
Than the least pity.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> To that end I would hear it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Theophilus, Sapritius</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Macrinus</span>.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> He comes; with him the governor.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> O, Sapritius,<br />
I am to chide you for your tenderness;<br />
But yet, remembering that you are a father,<br />
I will forget it. Good Theophilus,<br />
I'll speak with you anon.&mdash;Nearer, your ear.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>To</i></span> <span class="smcap">Sapritius</span>.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> [<i>aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Macrinus</span>.] By Antoninus' soul, I do conjure you,<br />
And though not for religion, for his friendship,<br />
Without demanding what's the cause that moves me,<br />
Receive my signet:&mdash;By the power of this,<br />
Go to my prisons, and release all Christians,<br />
That are in fetters there by my command.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> But what shall follow?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Haste then to the port;<br />
You there shall find two tall ships ready rigg'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>In which embark the poor distressed souls,<br />
And bear them from the reach of tyranny.<br />
Enquire not whither you are bound: the Deity<br />
That they adore will give you prosperous winds,<br />
And make your voyage such, and largely pay for<br />
Your hazard, and your travail. Leave me here;<br />
There is a scene that I must act alone:<br />
Haste, good Macrinus; and the great God guide you!</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> I'll undertake 't; there's something prompts me to it;<br />
'Tis to save innocent blood, a saint-like act:<br />
And to be merciful has never been<br />
By moral men themselves esteem'd a sin.
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> You know your charge?</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> And will with care observe it.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> For I profess he is not C&aelig;sar's friend,<br />
That sheds a tear for any torture that<br />
A Christian suffers. Welcome, my best servant,<br />
My careful, zealous provost! thou hast toil'd<br />
To satisfy my will, though in extremes:<br />
I love thee for 't; thou art firm rock, no changeling.<br />
Prithee deliver, and for my sake do it,<br />
Without excess of bitterness, or scoffs,<br />
Before my brother and these kings, how took<br />
The Christian her death?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> And such a presence,<br />
Though every private head in this large room<br />
Were circled round with an imperial crown,<br />
Her story will deserve, it is so full<br />
Of excellence and wonder.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Ha! how is this?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> O! mark it, therefore, and with that attention,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>As you would hear an embassy from heaven<br />
By a wing'd legate; for the truth deliver'd,<br />
Both how, and what, this blessed virgin suffer'd,<br />
And Dorothea but hereafter named,<br />
You will rise up with reverence, and no more,<br />
As things unworthy of your thoughts, remember<br />
What the canonized Spartan ladies were,<br />
Which lying Greece so boasts of. Your own matrons,<br />
Your Roman dames, whose figures you yet keep<br />
As holy relics, in her history<br />
Will find a second urn: Gracchus' Cornelia,<br />
Paulina, that in death desired to follow<br />
Her husband Seneca, nor Brutus' Portia,<br />
That swallow'd burning coals to overtake him,<br />
Though all their several worths were given to one,<br />
With this is to be mention'd.</p>

<p><i>Max.</i> Is he mad?</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Why, they did die, Theophilus, and boldly;<br />
This did no more.<br />
<br />
<i>Theoph.</i> They, out of desperation,<br />
Or for vain glory of an after-name,<br />
Parted with life: this had not mutinous sons,<br />
As the rash Gracchi were; nor was this saint<br />
A doting mother, as Cornelia was.<br />
This lost no husband, in whose overthrow<br />
Her wealth and honour sunk; no fear of want<br />
Did make her being tedious; but, aiming<br />
At an immortal crown, and in His cause<br />
Who only can bestow it; who sent down<br />
Legions of ministering angels to bear up<br />
Her spotless soul to heaven, who entertain'd it<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>With choice celestial music, equal to<br />
The motion of the spheres; she, uncompell'd,<br />
Changed this life for a better. My lord Sapritius,<br />
You were present at her death; did you e'er hear<br />
Such ravishing sounds?</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Yet you said then 'twas witchcraft,<br />
And devilish illusions.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> I then heard it<br />
With sinful ears, and belch'd out blasphemous words<br />
Against his Deity, which then I knew not,<br />
Nor did believe in him.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Why, dost thou now?<br />
Or dar'st thou, in our hearing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Were my voice<br />
As loud as is His thunder, to be heard<br />
Through all the world, all potentates on earth<br />
Ready to burst with rage, should they but hear it;<br />
Though hell, to aid their malice, lent her furies,<br />
Yet I would speak, and speak again, and boldly:<br />
I am a Christian; and the Powers you worship,<br />
But dreams of fools and madmen.</p>

<p><i>Max.</i> Lay hands on him.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Thou twice a child! for doting age so makes thee,<br />
Thou couldst not else, thy pilgrimage of life<br />
Being almost past through, in this last moment<br />
Destroy whate'er thou hast done good or great&mdash;<br />
Thy youth did promise much; and, grown a man,<br />
Thou mad'st it good, and, with increase of years,<br />
Thy actions still better'd: as the sun,<br />
Thou didst rise gloriously, kept'st a constant course<br />
In all thy journey; and now, in the evening,<br />
When thou shouldst pass with honour to thy rest,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Wilt thou fall like a meteor?</p>

<p><i>Sap.</i> Yet confess<br />
That thou art mad, and that thy tongue and heart<br />
Had no agreement.</p>

<p><i>Max.</i> Do; no way is left, else,<br />
To save thy life, Theophilus.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> But, refuse it,<br />
Destruction as horrid, and as sudden,<br />
Shall fall upon thee, as if hell stood open,<br />
And thou wert sinking thither.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> Hear me, yet;<br />
Hear, for my service past.</p>

<p><i>Artem.</i> What will he say?</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> As ever I deserved your favour, hear me,<br />
And grant one boon; 'tis not for life I sue for;<br />
Nor is it fit that I, that ne'er knew pity<br />
To any Christian, being one myself,<br />
Should look for any; no, I rather beg<br />
The utmost of your cruelty. I stand<br />
Accomptable for thousand Christians' deaths;<br />
And, were it possible that I could die<br />
A day for every one, then live again<br />
To be again tormented, 'twere to me<br />
An easy penance, and I should pass through<br />
A gentle cleansing fire; but, that denied me,<br />
It being beyond the strength of feeble nature,<br />
My suit is, you would have no pity on me.<br />
In mine own house there are a thousand engines<br />
Of studied cruelty, which I did prepare<br />
For miserable Christians; let me feel,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>As the Sicilian did his brazen bull<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>,<br />
The horrid'st you can find; and I will say,<br />
In death, that you are merciful.</p>

<p><i>Diocle.</i> Despair not;<br />
In this thou shalt prevail. Go fetch them hither:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">[<i>Exit some of the Guard.</i></span><br />
Death shall put on a thousand shapes at once,<br />
And so appear before thee; racks, and whips!&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Thy flesh, with burning pincers torn, shall feed<br />
The fire that heats them; and what's wanting to<br />
The torture of thy body, I'll supply<br />
In punishing thy mind. Fetch all the Christians<br />
That are in hold; and here, before his face,<br />
Cut them in pieces.</p>

<p><i>Theoph.</i> 'Tis not in thy power:<br />
It was the first good deed I ever did.<br />
They are removed out of thy reach; howe'er,<br />
I was determined for my sins to die,<br />
I first took order for their liberty;<br />
And still I dare thy worst.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GREAT_DUKE_OF_FLORENCE" id="THE_GREAT_DUKE_OF_FLORENCE">THE GREAT DUKE OF FLORENCE.</a></h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Great Duke of Florence.</span>] This play, under
the title of The Great Duke, was licensed by Sir Henry Herbert,
July 5th, 1627. The plot is raised on those slight materials
afforded by our old chroniclers in the life of Edgar, which
Mason has since worked up into the beautiful drama of Elfrida.</p>

<p>The first edition of this play was published 1636, when it
was preceded by two commendatory copies of verses by G.
Donne and J. Ford. Though highly and most deservedly
popular, it was not reprinted. This may be attributed, in
some measure, to the growing discontent of the times, which
perversely turned aside from scenes like these, to dwell with
fearful anxiety on those of turbulence and blood.&mdash;It is impossible
not to be charmed with the manner in which this play
is written. The style is worthy of the most polished stage.
An easy elevation and a mild dignity are preserved throughout,
which afford an excellent model for the transaction of dramatic
business between persons of high rank and refined education.
As to the subject, it is of itself of no great importance; but
this is somewhat compensated by the interest the principal
characters take in it, and the connexion of love with the views
of state.&mdash;The scenes between Giovanni and Lidia present a
most beautiful picture of artless attachment, and of that unreserved
innocence and tender simplicity which Massinger describes
in so eminently happy a manner. Were it not for the
scene of low buffoonery in the fourth act, where Petronella
assumes the dress and character of her mistress, The Great
Duke of Florence would have been a perfect and unrivalled
production.</p>

<p class="center"><small>THE TRULY HONOURED, AND MY NOBLE FAVOURER,</small></p>

<p class="center">SIR ROBERT WISEMAN, KNT.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p class="center"><small>OF THORRELL'S HALL, IN ESSEX.</small></p>

<p><small>SIR,</small></p>

<p>As I dare not be ungrateful for the many benefits you have
heretofore conferred upon me, so I have just reason to fear
that my attempting this way to make satisfaction (in some
measure) for so due a debt, will further engage me. However,
examples encourage me. The most able in my poor
quality have made use of dedications in this nature, to make
the world take notice (as far as in them lay) who and what
they were that gave supportment and protection to their
studies; being more willing to publish the doer, than receive
a benefit in a corner. For myself, I will freely, and with a
zealous thankfulness, acknowledge, that for many years I had
but faintly subsisted, if I had not often tasted of your bounty.
But it is above my strength and faculties to celebrate to the
desert your noble inclination, and that made actual, to raise
up, or, to speak more properly, to rebuild the ruins of demolished
poesie. But that is a work reserved, and will be, no
doubt, undertaken, and finished, by one that can to the life
express it. Accept, I beseech you, the tender of my service;
and in the list of those you have obliged to you, contemn not
the name of</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your true and faithful honourer,</span><br />
PHILIP MASSINGER.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center space-above"><b><big>THE GREAT DUKE OF FLORENCE.</big></b></p>


<h3>ACT I. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Country. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Contarino</span>.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> You bring your welcome with you.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Sir, I find it<br />
In every circumstance.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Again most welcome.<br />
Yet, give me leave to wish (and pray you excuse me,<br />
For I must use the freedom I was born with)<br />
The great duke's pleasure had commanded you<br />
To my poor house upon some other service;<br />
Not this you are design'd to: but his will<br />
Must be obey'd, howe'er it ravish from me<br />
The happy conversation of one<br />
As dear to me as the old Romans held<br />
Their household Lars, whom they believed had power<br />
To bless and guard their families.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> 'Tis received so<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>On my part, signior; nor can the duke<br />
But promise to himself as much as may<br />
Be hoped for from a nephew. And 'twere weakness<br />
In any man to doubt, that Giovanni<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>,<br />
Train'd up by your experience and care<br />
In all those arts peculiar and proper<br />
To future greatness, of necessity<br />
Must in his actions, being grown a man,<br />
Make good the princely education<br />
Which he derived from you.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I have discharged,<br />
To the utmost of my power, the trust the duke<br />
Committed to me, and with joy perceive<br />
The seed of my endeavours was not sown<br />
Upon the barren sands, but fruitful glebe,<br />
Which yields a large increase: my noble charge,<br />
By his sharp wit, and pregnant apprehension,<br />
Instructing those that teach him; making use,<br />
Not in a vulgar and pedantic form,<br />
Of what's read to him, but 'tis straight digested,<br />
And truly made his own. His grave discourse,<br />
In one no more indebted unto years,<br />
Amazes such as hear him: horsemanship,<br />
And skill to use his weapon, are by practice<br />
Familiar to him: as for knowledge in<br />
Music, he needs it not, it being born with him;<br />
All that he speaks being with such grace deliver'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
That it makes perfect harmony.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> You describe<br />
A wonder to me.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Sir, he is no less;<br />
And that there may be nothing wanting that<br />
May render him complete, the sweetness of<br />
His disposition so wins on all<br />
Appointed to attend him, that they are<br />
Rivals, even in the coarsest office, who<br />
Shall get precedency to do him service;<br />
Which they esteem a greater happiness<br />
Than if they had been fashion'd and built up<br />
To hold command o'er others.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> And what place<br />
Does he now bless with his presence?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> He is now<br />
Running at the ring<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, at which he's excellent.<br />
He does allot for every exercise<br />
A several hour; for sloth, the nurse of vices,<br />
And rust of action, is a stranger to him.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>But I fear I am tedious; let us pass,<br />
If you please, to some other subject, though I cannot<br />
Deliver him as he deserves.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> You have given him<br />
A noble character.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And how, I pray you,<br />
(For we, that never look beyond our villas,<br />
Must be inquisitive,) are state affairs<br />
Carried in court?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> There's little alteration:<br />
Some rise, and others fall, as it stands with<br />
The pleasure of the duke, their great disposer.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Does Lodovico Sanazarro hold<br />
Weight and grace with him?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Every day new honours<br />
Are shower'd upon him, and without the envy<br />
Of such as are good men; since all confess<br />
The service done our master in his wars<br />
'Gainst Pisa and Sienna may with justice<br />
Claim what's conferr'd upon him.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> 'Tis said nobly;<br />
For princes never more make known their wisdom,<br />
Than when they cherish goodness where they find it:<br />
They being men, and not gods, Contarino,<br />
They can give wealth and titles, but no virtues;<br />
That is without their power. When they advance,<br />
Not out of judgment, but deceiving fancy,<br />
An undeserving man, howe'er set off<br />
With all the trim of greatness, state, and power,<br />
And of a creature even grown terrible<br />
To him from whom he took his giant form,<br />
This thing is still a comet, no true star;<br />
And when the bounties feeding his false fire<br />
Begin to fail, will of itself go out,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>And what was dreadful proves ridiculous.<br />
But in our Sanazarro 'tis not so,<br />
He being pure and tried gold; and any stamp<br />
Of grace, to make him current to the world,<br />
The duke is pleased to give him, will add honour<br />
To the great bestower; for he, though allow'd<br />
Companion to his master, still preserves<br />
His majesty in full lustre.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> He, indeed,<br />
At no part does take from it, but becomes<br />
A partner of his cares, and eases him,<br />
With willing shoulders, of a burden which<br />
He should alone sustain.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Is he yet married?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> No, signior, still a bachelor; howe'er<br />
It is apparent that the choicest virgin<br />
For beauty, bravery, and wealth, in Florence,<br />
Would, with her parents' glad consent, be won,<br />
Were his affection and intent but known<br />
To be at his devotion.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> So I think too.<br />
But break we off&mdash;here comes my princely charge.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Calandrino</span>.</p>

<p>Make your approaches boldly; you will find<br />
A courteous entertainment.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[</span><span class="smcap">Cont.</span> <i>kneels</i>.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Pray you, forbear<br />
My hand, good signior; 'tis a ceremony<br />
Not due to me. 'Tis fit we should embrace<br />
With mutual arms.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> It is a favour, sir,<br />
I grieve to be denied.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> You shall o'ercome:<br />
But 'tis your pleasure, not my pride, that grants it.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>Nay, pray you, guardian, and good sir, put on:<br />
How ill it shows to have that reverend head<br />
Uncover'd to a boy!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Your excellence<br />
Must give me liberty to observe the distance<br />
And duty that I owe you.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Owe me duty!<br />
I do profess (and when I do deny it,<br />
Good fortune leave me!) you have been to me<br />
A second father, and may justly challenge,<br />
For training up my youth in arts and arms,<br />
As much respect and service as was due<br />
To him that gave me life. And did you know, sir,<br />
Or will believe from me, how many sleeps<br />
Good Charomonte hath broken, in his care<br />
To build me up a man, you must confess<br />
Chiron, the tutor to the great Achilles,<br />
Compared with him, deserves not to be named.<br />
And if my gracious uncle, the great duke,<br />
Still holds me worthy his consideration,<br />
Or finds in me aught worthy to be loved,<br />
That little rivulet flow'd from this spring;<br />
And so from me report him.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Fame already<br />
Hath fill'd his highness' ears with the true story<br />
Of what you are, and how much better'd by him;<br />
And 'tis his purpose to reward the travail<br />
Of this grave sir with a magnificent hand:<br />
For though his tenderness hardly could consent<br />
To have you one hour absent from his sight,<br />
For full three years he did deny himself<br />
The pleasure he took in you, that you, here,<br />
From this great master, might arrive unto<br />
The theory of those high mysteries<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Which you, by action, must make plain in court.<br />
'Tis, therefore, his request, (and that, from him,<br />
Your excellence must grant a strict command,)<br />
That instantly (it being not five hours' riding)<br />
You should take horse and visit him. These his letters<br />
Will yield you further reasons. [<i>Delivers a packet.</i></p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> To the court!<br />
Farewell the flower, then, of the country's garland.<br />
This is our sun, and when he's set we must not<br />
Expect or spring or summer, but resolve<br />
For a perpetual winter.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Pray you, observe<br />
<span style="margin-left:8em;">[</span><span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>reading the letters</i>.<br />
The frequent changes in his face.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> As if<br />
His much unwillingness to leave your house<br />
Contended with his duty.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Now he appears<br />
Collected and resolved.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> It is the duke!<br />
The duke, upon whose favour all my hopes<br />
And fortunes do depend; nor must I check<br />
At his commands for any private motives<br />
That do invite my stay here, though they are<br />
Almost not to be master'd. My obedience,<br />
In my departing suddenly, shall confirm<br />
I am his highness' creature; yet I hope<br />
A little stay to take a solemn farewell<br />
Of all those ravishing pleasures I have tasted<br />
In this my sweet retirement, from my guardian<br />
And his incomparable daughter, cannot meet<br />
An ill construction.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> I will answer that:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Use your own will.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I would speak to you, sir,<br />
In such a phrase as might express the thanks<br />
My heart would gladly pay; but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I conceive you:<br />
And something I would say; but I must do it<br />
In that dumb rhetoric which you make use of;<br />
For I do wish you all&mdash;&mdash;I know not how,<br />
My toughness melts, and, spite of my discretion,<br />
I must turn woman.
<span style="margin-left:4em;">[<i>Embraces</i></span> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> What a sympathy<br />
There is between them!</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Were I on the rack,<br />
I could not shed a tear. But I am mad,<br />
And, ten to one, shall hang myself for sorrow<br />
Before I shift my shirt. But hear you, sir,<br />
(I'll separate you), when you are gone, what will<br />
Become of me?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Why, thou shalt to court with me.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">[<i>Takes</i></span> <span class="smcap">Char.</span> <i>aside</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> To see you worried?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Worried, Calandrino!</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Yes, sir: for, bring this sweet face to the court,<br />
There will be such a longing 'mong the madams,<br />
Who shall engross it first, nay, fight and scratch for 't,<br />
That, if they be not stopp'd&mdash;&mdash;So much for him.<br />
There's something else that troubles me.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> What's that?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Why, how to behave myself in court, and tightly.<br />
I have been told the very place transforms men,<br />
And that not one of a thousand, that before<br />
Lived honestly in the country on plain salads,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>But bring him thither, mark me that, and feed him<br />
But a month or two with custards and court cake-bread,<br />
And he turns knave immediately.&mdash;I'd be honest;<br />
But I must follow the fashion, or die a beggar.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> And, if I ever reach my hopes, believe it,<br />
We will share fortunes.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> This acknowledgment</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lidia</span>.</p>

<p>Binds me your debtor ever.&mdash;Here comes one<br />
In whose sad looks you easily may read<br />
What her heart suffers, in that she is forced<br />
To take her last leave of you.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> As I live,<br />
A beauty without parallel!</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Must you go, then,<br />
So suddenly?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> There's no evasion, Lidia,<br />
To gain the least delay, though I would buy it<br />
At any rate. Greatness, with private men<br />
Esteem'd a blessing, is to me a curse;<br />
And we, whom, for our high births, they conclude<br />
The only freemen, are the only slaves.<br />
Happy the golden mean! Had I been born<br />
In a poor sordid cottage, not nursed up<br />
With expectation to command a court,<br />
I might, like such of your condition, sweetest,<br />
Have ta'en a safe and middle course, and not,<br />
As I am now, against my choice, compell'd<br />
Or to lie groveling on the earth, or raised<br />
So high upon the pinnacles of state,<br />
That I must either keep my height with danger,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Or fall with certain ruin.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Your own goodness<br />
Will be your faithful guard.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> O, Lidia!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> So passionate<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>!
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> For, had I been your equal,<br />
I might have seen and liked with mine own eyes,<br />
And not, as now, with others'; I might still,<br />
And without observation or envy,<br />
As I have done, continued my delights<br />
With you, that are alone, in my esteem,<br />
The abstract of society: we might walk<br />
In solitary groves, or in choice gardens;<br />
From the variety of curious flowers<br />
Contemplate nature's workmanship and wonders:<br />
And then, for change, near to the murmur of<br />
Some bubbling fountain, I might hear you sing,<br />
And, from the well-tuned accents of your tongue,<br />
In my imagination conceive<br />
With what melodious harmony a quire<br />
Of angels sing above their Maker's praises:<br />
And then with chaste discourse, as we return'd,<br />
Imp<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> feathers to the broken wings of time:&mdash;<br />
And all this I must part from.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> You forget<br />
The haste imposed upon us.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> One word more,<br />
And then I come. And after this, when, with<br />
Continued innocence of love and service,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>I had grown ripe for hymeneal joys,<br />
Embracing you, but with a lawful flame,<br />
I might have been your husband.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Sir, I was,<br />
And ever am, your servant; but it was,<br />
And 'tis, far from me in a thought to cherish<br />
Such saucy hopes. If I had been the heir<br />
Of all the globes and sceptres mankind bows to,<br />
At my best you had deserved me; as I am,<br />
Howe'er unworthy, in my virgin zeal<br />
I wish you, as a partner of your bed,<br />
A princess equal to you; such a one<br />
That may make it the study of her life,<br />
With all the obedience of a wife, to please you.<br />
May you have happy issue, and I live<br />
To be their humblest handmaid!</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I am dumb,<br />
And can make no reply.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Your excellence<br />
Will be benighted.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> This kiss, bathed in tears,<br />
May learn you what I should say.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Give me leave<br />
To wait on you to your horse.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And me to bring you<br />
To the one half of your journey.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Your love puts<br />
Your age to too much trouble.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I grow young,<br />
When most I serve you.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Sir, the duke shall thank you.

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Florence. A Room in the Palace.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonso, Hippolito</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hieronimo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alph.</i> His highness cannot take it ill.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> However,<br />
We with our duties shall express our care<br />
For the safety of his dukedom.</p>

<p><i>Hier.</i> And our loves</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cozimo</span>.</p>

<p>To his person.&mdash;Here he comes: present it boldly.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">[<i>They kneel</i>:</span> <span class="smcap">Alphonso</span> <i>tenders a paper</i>.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> What needs this form? We are not grown so proud<br />
As to disdain familiar conference<br />
With such as are to counsel and direct us.<br />
This kind of adoration show'd not well<br />
In the old Roman emperors, who, forgetting<br />
That they were flesh and blood, would be styled gods:<br />
In us to suffer it were worse. Pray you, rise.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">[<i>Reads.</i></span><br />
Still the old suit! With too much curiousness<br />
You have too often search'd this wound, which yields<br />
Security and rest, not trouble, to me.<br />
For here you grieve that my firm resolution<br />
Continues me a widower; and that<br />
My want of issue to succeed me in<br />
My government, when I am dead, may breed<br />
Distraction in the state, and make the name<br />
And family of the Medici, now admired,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>Contemptible.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> And with strong reasons, sir.</p>

<p><i>Alph.</i> For were you old, and past hope to beget<br />
The model of yourself, we should be silent.</p>

<p><i>Hier.</i> But being in your height and pride of years,<br />
As you are now, great sir; and having, too,<br />
In your possession the daughter of<br />
The deceased Duke of Urbin, and his heir,<br />
Whose guardian you are made; were you but pleased<br />
To think her worthy of you, besides children,<br />
The dukedom she brings with her for a dower<br />
Will yield a large increase of strength and power<br />
To those fair territories which already<br />
Acknowledge you their absolute lord.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> You press us<br />
With solid arguments, we grant; and, though<br />
We stand not bound to yield account to any<br />
Why we do this or that, (the full consent<br />
Of our subjects being included in our will,)<br />
We, out of our free bounties, will deliver<br />
The motives that divert<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> us. You well know<br />
That, three years since, to our much grief, we lost<br />
Our duchess; such a duchess, that the world,<br />
In her whole course of life<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, yields not a lady<br />
That can with imitation deserve<br />
To be her second; in her grave we buried<br />
All thoughts of woman: let this satisfy<br />
For any second marriage. Now, whereas<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>You name the heir of Urbin, as a princess<br />
Of great revenues, 'tis confess'd she is so:<br />
But for some causes, private to ourself,<br />
We have disposed her otherwise. Yet despair not;<br />
For you, ere long, with joy shall understand,<br />
That in our princely care we have provided<br />
One worthy to succeed us.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> We submit,<br />
And hold the counsels of great Cozimo<br />
Oraculous.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> My Sanazarro!&mdash;Nay,<br />
Forbear all ceremony. You look sprightly, friend,<br />
And promise in your clear aspect some novel<br />
That may delight us.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> O sir, I would not be<br />
The harbinger of aught that might distaste you;<br />
And therefore know (for 'twere a sin to torture<br />
Your highness' expectation) your vice-admiral,<br />
By my directions, hath surprised the galleys<br />
Appointed to transport the Asian tribute<br />
Of the great Turk. A richer prize was never<br />
Brought into Florence.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Still my nightingale,<br />
That with sweet accents dost assure me that<br />
My spring of happiness comes fast upon me!<br />
Embrace me boldly. I pronounce that wretch<br />
An enemy to brave and thriving action,<br />
That dares believe but in a thought, we are<br />
Too prodigal in our favours to this man,<br />
Whose merits, though with him we should divide<br />
Our dukedom, still continue us his debtor.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> 'Tis far from me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
<i>Alph.</i> We all applaud it.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Nay, blush not, Sanazarro; we are proud<br />
Of what we build up in thee; nor can our<br />
Election be disparaged, since we have not<br />
Received into our bosom and our grace<br />
A glorious<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> lazy drone, grown fat with feeding<br />
On others' toil, but an industrious bee,<br />
That crops the sweet flowers of our enemies,<br />
And every happy evening returns<br />
Loaden with wax and honey to our hive.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> My best endeavours never can discharge<br />
The service I should pay.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Thou art too modest;<br />
But we will study how to give, and when,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Contarino</span>.</p>

<p>Before it be demanded.&mdash;&mdash;Giovanni!<br />
My nephew! let me eye thee better, boy.<br />
In thee, methinks, my sister lives again;<br />
For her love I will be a father to thee,<br />
For thou art my adopted son.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Your servant,<br />
And humblest subject.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Thy hard travel, nephew,<br />
Requires soft rest, and therefore we forbear,<br />
For the present, an account how thou hast spent<br />
Thy absent hours. See, signiors, see, our care,<br />
Without a second bed, provides you of<br />
A hopeful prince. Carry him to his lodgings,<br />
And, for his further honour, Sanazarro,<br />
With the rest, do you attend him.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> All true pleasures<br />

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> As the rising sun,<br />

<p><i>Coz.</i> Contarino!</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> My gracious lord.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> What entertainment found you<br />
From Carolo de Charomonte?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Free,<br />
And bountiful. He's ever like himself,<br />
Noble and hospitable.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> But did my nephew<br />
Depart thence willingly?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> He obey'd your summons<br />
As did become him. Yet it was apparent,<br />
But that he durst not cross your will, he would<br />
Have sojourn'd longer there, he ever finding<br />
Variety of sweetest entertainment.<br />
But there was something else; nor can I blame<br />
His youth, though with some trouble he took leave<br />
Of such a sweet companion.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Who was it?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> The daughter, sir, of signior Carolo,<br />
Fair Lidia, a virgin, at all parts,<br />
But in her birth and fortunes, equal to him.<br />
The rarest beauties Italy can make boast of<br />
Are but mere shadows to her, she the substance<br />
Of all perfection. And what increases<br />
The wonder, sir, her body's matchless form<br />
Is better'd by the pureness of her soul.<br />
Such sweet discourse, such ravishing behaviour,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Such charming language, such enchanting manners,<br />
With a simplicity that shames all courtship<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>,<br />
Flow hourly from her, that I do believe<br />
Had Circe or Calypso her sweet graces,<br />
Wandering Ulysses never had remember'd<br />
Penelope, or Ithaca.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Be not rapt so.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Your excellence would be so, had you seen her.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Take up, take up<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.&mdash;But did your observation<br />
Note any passage of affection<br />
Between her and my nephew?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> How it should<br />
Be otherwise between them, is beyond<br />
My best imagination. Cupid's arrows<br />
Were useless there; for of necessity,<br />
Their years and dispositions do accord so,<br />
They must wound one another.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Umph! Thou art<br />
My secretary, Contarino, and more skill'd<br />
In politic designs of state, than in<br />
Thy judgment of a beauty; give me leave,<br />
In this, to doubt it.&mdash;Here. Go to my cabinet,<br />
You shall find there letters newly received,<br />
Touching the state of Urbin.<br />
Pray you, with care peruse them: leave the search<br />
Of this to us.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> I do obey in all things.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Lidia! a diamond so long conceal'd,<br />
And never worn in court! of such sweet feature!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>And he on whom I fix my dukedom's hopes<br />
Made captive to it! Umph! 'tis somewhat strange.<br />
Our eyes are every where, and we will make<br />
A strict inquiry.&mdash;Sanazarro!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Is my nephew at his rest?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I saw him in bed, sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> 'Tis well; and does the princess Fiorinda,<br />
Nay, do not blush, she is rich Urbin's heir,<br />
Continue constant in her favours to you?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Dread sir, she may dispense them as she pleases;<br />
But I look up to her as on a princess<br />
I dare not be ambitious of, and hope<br />
Her prodigal graces shall not render me<br />
Offender to your highness.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Not a scruple.<br />
He whom I favour, as I do my friend,<br />
May take all lawful graces that become him:<br />
But touching this hereafter. I have now<br />
(And though perhaps it may appear a trifle)<br />
Serious employment for thee.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I stand ready<br />
For any act you please.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> I know it, friend.<br />
Have you ne'er heard of Lidia, the daughter<br />
Of Carolo Charomonte?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Him I know, sir,<br />
For a noble gentleman, and my worthy friend;<br />
But never heard of her.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> She is deliver'd,<br />
And feelingly to us, by Contarino,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>For a masterpiece in nature. I would have you<br />
Ride suddenly thither to behold this wonder,<br />
But not as sent by us; that's our first caution:<br />
The second is, and carefully observe it,<br />
That, though you are a bachelor, and endow'd with<br />
All those perfections that may take a virgin,<br />
On forfeit of our favour do not tempt her:<br />
It may be her fair graces do concern us.<br />
Pretend what business you think fit, to gain<br />
Access unto her father's house, and, there,<br />
Make full discovery of her, and return me<br />
A true relation:&mdash;I have some ends in it,<br />
With which we will acquaint you.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> This is, sir,<br />
An easy task.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Yet one that must exact<br />
Your secrecy and diligence. Let not<br />
Your stay be long.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> It shall not, sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Farewell,<br />
And be, as you would keep our favour, careful.<br />

<h3>ACT II. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Fiorinda</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fiorinda</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Calaminta</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> How does this dressing show?</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> 'Tis of itself<br />
Curious and rare; but, borrowing ornament,<br />
As it does from your grace, that deigns to wear it,<br />
Incomparable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<i>Fior.</i> Thou flatter'st me.</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> I cannot,<br />
Your excellence is above it.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Were we less perfect,<br />
Yet, being as we are, an absolute princess,<br />
We of necessity must be chaste, wise, fair,<br />
By our prerogative!&mdash;yet all these fail<br />
To move where I would have them. How received<br />
Count Sanazarro the rich scarf I sent him<br />
For his last visit?</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> With much reverence,<br />
I dare not say affection. He express'd<br />
More ceremony in his humble thanks,<br />
Than feeling of the favour; and appear'd<br />
Wilfully ignorant, in my opinion,<br />
Of what it did invite him to.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> No matter;<br />
He's blind with too much light<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Have you not heard<br />
Of any private mistress he's engaged to?</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> Not any; and this does amaze me, madam,<br />
That he, a soldier, should in his manners<br />
Be so averse to women.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Troth, I know not.</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> I do suspect him; for I learnt last night,<br />
When the great duke went to rest, attended by<br />
One private follower, he took horse; but whither<br />
He's rid, or to what end, I cannot guess at,<br />
But I will find it out.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Do, faithful servant;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Calandrino</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>We would not be abused.&mdash;Who have we here?</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> How the fool stares!</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> And looks as if he were<br />
Conning his neck-verse.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> If I now prove perfect<br />
In my A B C of courtship, Calandrino<br />
Is made for ever. I am sent&mdash;let me see,<br />
On a <i>How d'ye</i>, as they call 't.</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> What wouldst thou say?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Let me see my notes. These are her lodgings; well.</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> Art thou an ass?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Peace! thou art a court wagtail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<i>Looking on his instructions.</i></span><br />
To interrupt me.</p>

<p><i>Fior</i>. He has given it you.</p>

<p>Cal. <i>And then say to the illustrious Fi-o-rin-da</i>&mdash;<br />
I have it. Which is she?</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> Why this; fop-doodle.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Leave chattering, bull-finch; you would put me out,<br />
But 'twill not do.&mdash;<i>Then, after you have made<br />
Your three obeisances to her, kneel, and kiss<br />
The skirt of her gown.</i>&mdash;I am glad it is no worse.</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> This is sport unlook'd for.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Are you the princess?</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Then stand fair,<br />
For I am choleric; and do not nip<br />
A hopeful blossom. Out again:&mdash;<i>Three low<br />
Obeisances</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I am ready.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> I come on, then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<i>Calam.</i> With much formality.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Umph! One, two, three.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">[<i>Makes antic courtesies.</i></span><br />
Thus far I am right. Now for the last. [<i>Kisses the skirt of her gown.</i>]&mdash;O, rare!<br />
She is perfumed all over! Sure great women,<br />
Instead of little dogs, are privileged<br />
To carry musk-cats.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Now the ceremony<br />
Is pass'd, what is the substance?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> I'll peruse<br />
My instructions, and then tell you.&mdash;<i>Her skirt kiss'd,<br />
Inform her highness that your lord</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> Who's that?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Prince Giovanni, who entreats your grace,<br />
That he, with your good favour, may have leave<br />
To present his service to you. I think I have nick'd it<br />
For a courtier of the first form.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> To my wonder.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>and a Gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>Return unto the prince&mdash;but he prevents<br />
My answer. Calaminta, take him off;<br />
And, for the neat delivery of his message,<br />
Give him ten ducats: such rare parts as yours<br />
Are to be cherish'd.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> We will share: I know<br />
It is the custom of the court, when ten<br />
Are promised, five is fair. Fie! fie! the princess<br />
Shall never know it, so you despatch me quickly,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
And bid me not come to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> Very good, sir.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Exeunt</i></span> <span class="smcap">Calandrino</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Calaminta</span>.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Pray you, friend,<br />
Inform the duke I am putting into act<br />
What he commanded.</p>

<p><i>Gent.</i> I am proud to be employ'd, sir.
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Madam, that, without warrant, I presume<br />
To trench upon your privacies, may argue<br />
Rudeness of manners; but the free access<br />
Your princely courtesy vouchsafes to all<br />
That come to pay their services, gives me hope<br />
To find a gracious pardon.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> If you please, not<br />
To make that an offence in your construction,<br />
Which I receive as a large favour from you,<br />
There needs not this apology.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> You continue,<br />
As you were ever, the greatest mistress of<br />
Fair entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> You are, sir, the master;<br />
And in the country have learnt to outdo<br />
All that in court is practised. But why should we<br />
Talk at such distance? You are welcome, sir.<br />
We have been more familiar, and since<br />
You will impose the province (you should govern)<br />
Of boldness on me, give me leave to say<br />
You are too punctual. Sit, sir, and discourse<br />
As we were used.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Your excellence knows so well<br />
How to command, that I can never err<br />
When I obey you.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Nay, no more of this.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>You shall o'ercome; no more, I pray you, sir.&mdash;<br />
And what delights, pray you be liberal<br />
In your relation, hath the country life<br />
Afforded you?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> All pleasures, gracious madam,<br />
But the happiness to converse with your sweet virtues.<br />
I had a grave instructor, and my hours<br />
Design'd to serious studies yielded me<br />
Pleasure with profit, in the knowledge of<br />
What before I was ignorant in; the signior,<br />
Carolo de Charomonte, being skilful<br />
To guide me through the labyrinth of wild passions,<br />
That labour'd to imprison my free soul<br />
A slave to vicious sloth.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> You speak him well.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> But short of his deserts. Then for the time<br />
Of recreation, I was allow'd<br />
(Against the form follow'd by jealous parents<br />
In Italy) full liberty to partake<br />
His daughter's sweet society. She's a virgin<br />
Happy in all endowments which a poet<br />
Could fancy in his mistress; being herself<br />
A school of goodness, where chaste maids may learn,<br />
Without the aids of foreign principles,<br />
By the example of her life and pureness,<br />
To be as she is, excellent. I but give you<br />
A brief epitome of her virtues, which,<br />
Dilated on at large, and to their merit,<br />
Would make an ample story.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Your whole age,<br />
So spent with such a father, and a daughter,<br />
Could not be tedious to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
<i>Giov.</i> True, great princess:<br />
And now, since you have pleased to grant the hearing<br />
Of my time's expense in the country, give me leave<br />
To entreat the favour to be made acquainted<br />
What service, or what objects in the court,<br />
Have, in your excellency's acceptance, proved<br />
Most gracious to you.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I'll meet your demand,<br />
And make a plain discovery. The duke's care<br />
For my estate and person holds the first<br />
And choicest place: then, the respect the courtiers<br />
Pay gladly to me, not to be contemn'd.<br />
But that which raised in me the most delight,<br />
(For I am a friend to valour,) was to hear<br />
The noble actions truly reported<br />
Of the brave count Sanazarro. I profess,<br />
When it hath been, and fervently, deliver'd,<br />
How boldly, in the horror of a fight,<br />
Cover'd with fire and smoke, and, as if nature<br />
Had lent him wings, like lightning he hath fallen<br />
Upon the Turkish galleys, I have heard it<br />
With a kind of pleasure, which hath whisper'd to me,<br />
This worthy must be cherish'd.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> 'Twas a bounty<br />
You never can repent.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I glory in it.<br />
And when he did return, (but still with conquest,)<br />
His armour off, not young Antinous<br />
Appear'd more courtly; all the graces that<br />
Render a man's society dear to ladies,<br />
Like pages waiting on him; and it does<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Work strangely on me.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> To divert your thoughts,<br />
Though they are fix'd upon a noble subject,<br />
I am a suitor to you.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> You will ask,<br />
I do presume, what I may grant, and then<br />
It must not be denied.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> It is a favour<br />
For which I hope your excellence will thank me.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Nay, without circumstance.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> That you would please<br />
To take occasion to move the duke,<br />
That you, with his allowance, may command<br />
This matchless virgin, Lidia, (of whom<br />
I cannot speak too much,) to wait upon you.<br />
She's such a one, upon the forfeit of<br />
Your good opinion of me, that will not<br />
Be a blemish to your train.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> 'Tis rank! he loves her:<br />
But I will fit him with a suit. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;I pause not,<br />
As if it bred or doubt or scruple in me<br />
To do what you desire, for I'll effect it,<br />
And make use of a fair and fit occasion;<br />
Yet, in return, I ask a boon of you,<br />
And hope to find you, in your grant to me,<br />
As I have been to you.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Command me, madam.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> 'Tis near allied to yours. That you would be<br />
A suitor to the duke, not to expose,<br />
After so many trials of his faith,<br />
The noble Sanazarro to all dangers,<br />
As if he were a wall to stand the fury<br />
Of a perpetual battery: but now<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>To grant him, after his long labours, rest<br />
And liberty to live in court; his arms<br />
And his victorious sword and shield hung up<br />
For monuments.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Umph!&mdash;I'll embrace, fair princess,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cozimo</span>.</p>

<p>The soonest opportunity. The duke!</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Nay, blush not; we smile on your privacy,<br />
And come not to disturb you. You are equals,<br />
And, without prejudice to either's honours,<br />
May make a mutual change of love and courtship,<br />
Till you are made one, and with holy rites,<br />
And we give suffrage to it.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> You are gracious.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> To ourself in this: but now break off; too much<br />
Taken at once of the most curious viands,<br />
Dulls the sharp edge of appetite. We are now<br />
For other sports, in which our pleasure is<br />
That you should keep us company.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> We attend you.

With that thin composition call'd small beer,<br />
As, 'tis said, they do in England. But Italians,<br />
That think when they have supp'd upon an olive,<br />
A root, or bunch of raisins, 'tis a feast,<br />
Must kill those crudities rising from cold herbs,<br />
With hot and lusty wines.</p>

Store of wine there?</p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> Yes, and drink more in two hours<br />
Than the Dutchmen or the Dane in four and twenty.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> But what is 't? French trash, made of rotten grapes,<br />
And dregs and lees of Spain, with Welsh metheglin,<br />
A drench to kill a horse! But this pure nectar,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>Being proper to our climate, is too fine<br />
To brook the roughness of the sea: the spirit<br />

My lord with your being here.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Tell him I come<br />
For a visit only. 'Tis a handsome pile this.
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> Why here is a brave fellow, and a right one;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Nor wealth nor greatness makes him proud.</p>

<p><i>Bern.</i> There are<br />
Too few of them; for most of our new courtiers,<br />
(Whose fathers were familiar with the prices<br />
Of oil and corn, with when and where to vent them,<br />
And left their heirs rich, from their knowledge that way,)<br />
Like gourds shot up in a night, disdain to speak<br />
But to cloth of tissue.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span> <i>in a nightgown</i>, <span class="smcap">Petruchio</span>
<i>following</i>.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Stand you prating, knaves,<br />
When such a guest is under my roof! See all<br />
The rooms perfumed. This is the man that carries<br />
The sway and swing of the court; and I had rather<br />
Preserve him mine with honest offices, than&mdash;&mdash;<br />
But I'll make no comparisons. Bid my daughter<br />
Trim herself up to the height. Which way went he?</p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> To the round gallery.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I will entertain him<br />
As fits his worth and quality, but no further.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>


<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Gallery in the same.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I cannot apprehend, yet I have argued<br />
All ways I can imagine, for what reasons<br />
The great duke does employ me hither; and,<br />
What does increase the miracle, I must render<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>A strict and true account, at my return,<br />
Of Lidia, this lord's daughter, and describe<br />
In what she's excellent, and where defective.<br />
'Tis a hard task: he that will undergo<br />
To make a judgment of a woman's beauty,<br />
And see through all her plasterings and paintings,<br />
Had need of Lynceus' eyes, and with more ease<br />
May look, like him, through nine mud walls, than make<br />
A true discovery of her. But the intents<br />
And secrets of my prince's heart must be<br />
Served, and not search'd into.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span>.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Most noble sir,<br />
Excuse my age, subject to ease and sloth,<br />
That with no greater speed I have presented<br />
My service with your welcome.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis more fit<br />
That I should ask your pardon, for disturbing<br />
Your rest at this unseasonable hour.<br />
But my occasions carrying me so near<br />
Your hospitable house, my stay being short too,<br />
Your goodness, and the name of friend, which you<br />
Are pleased to grace me with, gave me assurance<br />
A visit would not offend.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Offend, my lord!<br />
I feel myself much younger for the favour.<br />
How is it with our gracious master?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> He, sir,<br />
Holds still his wonted greatness, and confesses<br />
Himself your debtor, for your love and care<br />
To the prince Giovanni; and had sent<br />
Particular thanks by me, had his grace known<br />
The quick despatch of what I was design'd to<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Would have licensed me to see you.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I am rich<br />
In his acknowledgment.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I have heard<br />
Your happiness in a daughter.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Sits the wind there?
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Fame gives her out for a rare masterpiece.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> 'Tis a plain village girl, sir, but obedient;<br />
That's her best beauty, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Let my desire<br />
To see her find a fair construction from you:<br />
I bring no loose thought with me.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> You are that way,<br />
My lord, free from suspicion. Her own manners,<br />
Without an imposition from me,<br />
I hope, will prompt her to it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lidia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Petronella</span>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em;">As she is,</span><br />
She comes to make a tender of that service<br />
Which she stands bound to pay.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> With your fair leave,<br />
I make bold to salute you.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Sir, you have it.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> How he falls off!</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> My lord, though silence best becomes a maid,<br />
And to be curious to know but what<br />
Concerns myself, and with becoming distance,<br />
May argue me of boldness, I must borrow<br />
So much of modesty, as to inquire<br />
Prince Giovanni's health.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> He cannot want<br />
What you are pleased to wish him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<i>Lid.</i> Would 'twere so!<br />
And then there is no blessing that can make<br />
A hopeful and a noble prince complete,<br />
But should fall on him. O! he was our north star,<br />
The light and pleasure of our eyes.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Where am I?<br />
I feel myself another thing! Can charms<br />
Be writ on such pure rubies<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>? her lips melt<br />
As soon as touch'd! Not those smooth gales that glide<br />
O'er happy Araby, or rich Sab&aelig;a,<br />
Creating in their passage gums and spices,<br />
Can serve for a weak simile to express<br />
The sweetness of her breath. Such a brave stature<br />
Homer bestow'd on Pallas, every limb<br />
Proportion'd to it!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> This is strange.&mdash;My lord!</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I crave your pardon, and yours, matchless maid,<br />
For such I must report you.</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> There's no notice<br />
Taken all this while of me.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> And I must add,<br />
If your discourse and reason parallel<br />
The rareness of your more than human form,<br />
You are a wonder.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Pray you, my lord, make trial:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>She can speak, I can assure you; and that my presence<br />
May not take from her freedom, I will leave you:<br />
For know, my lord, my confidence dares trust her<br />
Where, and with whom, she pleases.&mdash;Petronella!</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> Yes, my good lord.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I have employment for you.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">[<i>Exeunt</i></span> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Petronella</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> What's your will, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Madam, you are so large a theme to treat of,<br />
And every grace about you offers to me<br />
Such copiousness of language, that I stand<br />
Doubtful which first to touch at. If I err,<br />
As in my choice I may, let me entreat you,<br />
Before I do offend, to sign my pardon:<br />
Let this, the emblem of your innocence,<br />
Give me assurance.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> My hand join'd to yours,<br />
Without this superstition, confirms it.<br />
Nor need I fear you will dwell long upon me,<br />
The barrenness of the subject yielding nothing<br />
That rhetoric, with all her tropes and figures,<br />
Can amplify. Yet since you are resolved<br />
To prove yourself a courtier in my praise,<br />
As I'm a woman (and you men affirm<br />
Our sex loves to be flatter'd) I'll endure it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span> <i>above</i>.</p>

<p>Now, when you please, begin.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> [<i>turning from her.</i>] If the great duke<br />
Made this his end to try my constant temper,<br />
Though I am vanquished, 'tis his fault, not mine;<br />
For I am flesh and blood, and have affections<br />
Like other men. Who can behold the temples,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>Or holy altars, but the objects work<br />
Devotion in him? And I may as well<br />
Walk over burning iron with bare feet,<br />
And be unscorch'd, as look upon this beauty<br />
Without desire, and that desire pursued too,<br />
Till it be quench'd with the enjoying those<br />
Delights, which to achieve, danger is nothing,<br />
And loyalty but a word.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> I ne'er was proud;<br />
Nor can find I am guilty of a thought<br />
Deserving this neglect.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Suppose his greatness<br />
Loves her himself, why makes he choice of me<br />
To be his agent? It is tyranny<br />
To call one pinch'd with hunger to a feast,<br />
And at that instant cruelly deny him<br />
To taste of what he sees. Allegiance<br />
Tempted too far is like the trial of<br />
A good sword on an anvil; as that often<br />
Flies in pieces without service to the owner,<br />
So trust enforced too far proves treachery,<br />
And is too late repented.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Pray you, sir,<br />
Or license me to leave you, or deliver<br />
The reasons which invite you to command<br />
My tedious waiting on you.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> As I live,<br />
I know not what to think on 't. Is 't his pride,<br />
Or his simplicity?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Whither have my thoughts<br />
Carried me from myself? In this my dulness,<br />
I've lost an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">[<i>Turns to her; she falls off.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> 'Tis true<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>I was not bred in court, nor live a star there;<br />
Nor shine in rich embroideries and pearl,<br />
As they that are the mistresses of great fortunes<br />
Are every day adorn'd with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Will you vouchsafe<br />
Your ear, sweet lady?</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Yet I may be bold,<br />
For my integrity and fame, to rank<br />
With such as are more glorious. Though I never<br />
Did injury, yet I am sensible<br />
When I'm contemn'd and scorn'd.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Will you please to hear me?</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> O the difference of natures! Giovanni,<br />
A prince in expectation, when he lived here,<br />
Stole courtesy from heaven<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>, and would not to<br />
The meanest servant in my father's house<br />
Have kept such distance.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Pray you, do not think me<br />
Unworthy of your ear: it was your beauty<br />
That turn'd me statue. I can speak, fair lady.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> And I can hear. The harshness of your courtship<br />
Cannot corrupt my courtesy.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Will you hear me,<br />
If I speak of love?</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Provided you be modest;<br />
I were uncivil, else.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> They are come to parley:<br />
I must observe this nearer.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>He retires.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> You are a rare one,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>And such (but that my haste commands me hence)<br />
I could converse with ever. Will you grace me<br />
With leave to visit you again?</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> So you,<br />
At your return to court, do me the favour<br />
To make a tender of my humble service<br />
To the prince Giovanni.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Ever touching<br />
Upon that string! [<i>Aside.</i>] And will you give me hope<br />
Of future happiness?</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> That, as I shall find you:<br />
The fort that's yielded at the first assault<br />
Is hardly worth the taking.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span> <i>below</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> She is a magazine of all perfection,<br />
And 'tis death to part from her, yet I must.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> A homely breakfast does attend your lordship,<br />
Such as the place affords.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> No; I have feasted<br />
Already here; my thanks, and so I leave you:<br />
I will see you again.&mdash;Till this unhappy hour<br />
I was never lost; and what to do, or say,<br />
I have not yet determined.
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">[<i>Aside, and exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Gone so abruptly!<br />
'Tis very strange.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Under your favour, sir,<br />
His coming hither was to little purpose,<br />
For any thing I heard from him.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Take heed, Lidia!<br />
I do advise you with a father's love,<br />
And tenderness of your honour; as I would not<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>Have you too harsh in giving entertainment,<br />
So by no means be credulous: for great men,<br />
Till they have gain'd their ends, are giants in<br />
Their promises, but, those obtain'd, weak pigmies<br />
In their performance. And it is a maxim<br />
Allow'd among them, so they may deceive,<br />
They may swear any thing; for the queen of love,<br />
As they hold constantly, does never punish,<br />
But smile at, lovers' perjuries<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.&mdash;Yet be wise too,<br />
And when you are sued to in a noble way,<br />
Be neither nice nor scrupulous.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> All you speak, sir,<br />
I hear as oracles; nor will digress<br />
From your directions.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> So shall you keep<br />
Your fame untainted.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> As I would my life, sir.
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>


<h3>ACT III. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Florence. An Anteroom in the Palace.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span> <i>and Servant</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Leave the horses with my grooms; but be you careful,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>With your best diligence and speed, to find out<br />
The prince, and humbly, in my name, entreat<br />
I may exchange some private conference with him<br />
Before the great duke know of my arrival.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> I haste, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Here I'll attend his coming:<br />
And see you keep yourself, as much as may be,<br />
Conceal'd from all men else.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> To serve your lordship,<br />
I wish I were invisible.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I am driven<br />
Into a desperate strait, and cannot steer<br />
A middle course; and of the two extremes<br />
Which I must make election of, I know not<br />
Which is more full of horror. Never servant<br />
Stood more engaged to a magnificent master,<br />
Than I to Cozimo: and all those honours<br />
And glories by his grace conferr'd upon me,<br />
Or by my prosperous services deserved,<br />
If now I should deceive his trust, and make<br />
A shipwreck of my loyalty, are ruin'd.<br />
And, on the other side, if I discover<br />
Lidia's divine perfections, all my hopes<br />
In her are sunk, never to be buoy'd up:<br />
For 'tis impossible, but, as soon as seen,<br />
She must with adoration be sued to.<br />
A hermit at his beads but looking on her<br />
At this object would take fire. Nor is the duke<br />
Such an Hippolytus, but that this Ph&aelig;dra,<br />
But seen, must force him to forsake the groves<br />
And Dian's huntmanship, proud to serve under<br />
Venus' soft ensigns. No, there is no way<br />
For me to hope fruition of my ends,<br />
But to conceal her beauties;&mdash;and how that<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>May be effected is as hard a task<br />
As with a veil to cover the sun's beams,<br />
Or comfortable light. Three years the prince<br />
Lived in her company, and Contarino,<br />
The secretary, hath possess'd<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the duke<br />
What a rare piece she is:&mdash;but he's my creature,<br />
And may with ease be frighted to deny<br />
What he hath said: and if my long experience,<br />
With some strong reasons I have thought upon,<br />
Cannot o'er-reach a youth, my practice yields me<br />
But little profit.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>with the Servant</i>.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> You are well return'd, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Leave us.&mdash;[<i>Exit Servant.</i>] When that your grace shall know the motives<br />
That forced me to invite you to this trouble,<br />
You will excuse my manners.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Sir, there needs not<br />
This circumstance between us. You are ever<br />
My noble friend.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> You shall have further cause<br />
To assure you of my faith and zeal to serve you:<br />
And when I have committed to your trust<br />
(Presuming still on your retentive silence)<br />
A secret of no less importance than<br />
My honour, nay, my head, it will confirm<br />
What value you hold with me.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Pray you, believe, sir,<br />
What you deliver to me shall be lock'd up<br />
In a strong cabinet, of which you yourself<br />
Shall keep the key; for here I pawn my honour,<br />
Which is the best security I can give yet,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
It shall not be discover'd.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> This assurance<br />
Is more than I with modesty could demand<br />
From such a paymaster; but I must be sudden;<br />
And, therefore, to the purpose. Can your excellence,<br />
In your imagination, conceive<br />
On what design, or whither, the duke's will<br />
Commanded me hence last night?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> No, I assure you;<br />
And it had been a rudeness to inquire<br />
Of that I was not call'd to.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Grant me hearing,<br />
And I will make you truly understand<br />
It only did concern you.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Me, my lord!</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> You, in your present state and future fortunes;<br />
For both lie at the stake.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> You much amaze me.<br />
Pray you, resolve this riddle.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> You know the duke,<br />
If he die issueless, as yet he is,<br />
Determines you his heir.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> It hath pleased his highness<br />
Oft to profess so much.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> But say he should<br />
Be won to prove a second wife, on whom<br />
He may beget a son, how, in a moment,<br />
Will all those glorious expectations, which<br />
Render you reverenced and remarkable,<br />
Be in a moment blasted, howe'er you are<br />
His much-loved sister's son!</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I must bear it<br />
With patience, and in me it is a duty<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>That I was born with; and 'twere much unfit<br />
For the receiver of a benefit<br />
To offer, for his own ends, to prescribe<br />
Laws to the giver's pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Sweetly answer'd,<br />
And like your noble self. This your rare temper<br />
So wins upon me, that I would not live<br />
(If that by honest arts I can prevent it)<br />
To see your hopes made frustrate. And but think<br />
How you shall be transform'd from what you are,<br />
Should this (as Heaven avert it!) ever happen.<br />
It must disturb your peace: for whereas now,<br />
Being, as you are, received for the heir-apparent,<br />
You are no sooner seen but wonder'd at;<br />
The signiors making it a business to<br />
Inquire how you have slept; and, as you walk<br />
The streets of Florence, the glad multitude<br />
In throngs press but to see you; and, with joy,<br />
The father, pointing with his finger, tells<br />
His son, This is the prince, the hopeful prince,<br />
That must hereafter rule, and you obey him.&mdash;<br />
Great ladies beg your picture, and make love<br />
To that, despairing to enjoy the substance.&mdash;<br />
And but the last night, when 'twas only rumour'd<br />
That you were come to court, as if you had<br />
By sea pass'd hither from another world,<br />
What general shouts and acclamations follow'd!<br />
The bells rang loud, the bonfires blazed, and such<br />
As loved not wine, carousing to your health,<br />
Were drunk, and blush'd not at it. And is this<br />
A happiness to part with?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I allow these<br />
As flourishes of fortune, with which princes<br />
Are often soothed; but never yet esteem'd them<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
For real blessings.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Yet all these were paid<br />
To what you may be, not to what you are;<br />
For if the Great Duke but show to his servants<br />
A son of his own, you shall, like one obscure,<br />
Pass unregarded.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I confess, command<br />
Is not to be contemn'd, and if my fate<br />
Appoint me to it, as I may, I'll bear it<br />
With willing shoulders. But, my lord, as yet,<br />
You've told me of a danger coming towards me,<br />
But have not named it.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> That is soon deliver'd.<br />
Great Cozimo, your uncle, as I more<br />
Than guess, for 'tis no frivolous circumstance<br />
That does persuade my judgment to believe it,<br />
Purposes to be married.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Married, sir!<br />
With whom, and on what terms? pray you, instruct me.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> With the fair Lidia.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Lidia!</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> The daughter<br />
Of signior Charomonte.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Pardon me<br />
Though I appear incredulous; for, on<br />
My knowledge, he ne'er saw her.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> That is granted:<br />
But Contarino hath so sung her praises,<br />
And given her out for such a masterpiece,<br />
That he's transported with it, sir:&mdash;and love<br />
Steals sometimes through the ear into the heart,<br />
As well as by the eye. The duke no sooner<br />
Heard her described, but I was sent in post<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
To see her, and return my judgment of her.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> And what's your censure<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis a pretty creature.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> She's very fair.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Yes, yes, I have seen worse faces.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Her limbs are neatly form'd.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> She hath a waist<br />
Indeed sized to love's wish.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> A delicate hand too.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Then for a leg and foot&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> And there I leave you,<br />
For I presumed no further.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> As she is, sir,<br />
I know she wants no gracious part that may<br />
Allure the duke; and, if he only see her,<br />
She is his own; he will not be denied,<br />
And then you are lost: yet, if you'll second me,<br />
(As you have reason, for it most concerns you,)<br />
I can prevent all yet.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I would you could,<br />
A noble way.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I will cry down her beauties;<br />
Especially the beauties of her mind,<br />
As much as Contarino hath advanced them;<br />
And this, I hope, will breed forgetfulness,<br />
And kill affection in him: but you must join<br />
With me in my report, if you be question'd.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I never told a lie yet; and I hold it<br />

What's worthy admiration: yet, for once,<br />
I will dispraise a little, and not vary<br />
From your relation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
<i>Sanaz.</i> Be constant in it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonso</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alph.</i> My lord, the duke hath seen your man, and wonders</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cozimo, Hippolito, Contarino</span>, <i>and
Attendants.</i></p>

<p>You come not to him. See, if his desire<br />
To have conference with you hath not brought him hither<br />
In his own person!</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> They are comely coursers,<br />
And promise swiftness.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> They are, of my knowledge,<br />
Of the best race in Naples.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> You are, nephew,<br />
As I hear, an excellent horseman, and we like it:<br />
'Tis a fair grace in a prince. Pray you, make trial<br />
Of their strength and speed; and, if you think them fit<br />
For your employment, with a liberal hand<br />
Reward the gentleman that did present them<br />
From the viceroy of Naples.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I will use<br />
My best endeavour, sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Wait on my nephew.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">[<i>Exeunt</i></span> <span class="smcap">Giovanni, Alphonso, Hippolito</span>, <i>and Attendants.</i><br />
Nay, stay you, Contarino:&mdash;be within call;<br />
It may be we shall use you. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Contarino.</span>] You have rode hard, sir,<br />
And we thank you for it: every minute seems<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>Irksome, and tedious to us, till you have<br />
Made your discovery. Say, friend, have you seen<br />
This ph&oelig;nix of our age?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I have seen a maid, sir;<br />
But, if that I have judgment, no such wonder<br />
As she was deliver'd to you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> This is strange.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> But certain truth. It may be, she was look'd on<br />
With admiration in the country, sir;<br />
But, if compared with many in your court,<br />
She would appear but ordinary.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Contarino<br />
Reports her otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Such as ne'er saw swans<br />
May think crows beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> How is her behaviour?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis like the place she lives in.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> How her wit,<br />
Discourse, and entertainment?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Very coarse;<br />
I would not willingly say poor, and rude:<br />
But, had she all the beauties of fair women,<br />
The dulness of her soul would fright me from her.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> You are curious, sir. I know not what to think on 't.&mdash;      [<i>Aside.</i><br />
Contarino!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Contarino.</span></p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Where was thy judgment, man,<br />
To extol a virgin Sanazarro tells me<br />
Is nearer to deformity?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I saw her,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>And curiously perused her; and I wonder<br />
That she, that did appear to me, that know<br />
What beauty is, not worthy the observing,<br />
Should so transport you.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Troth, my lord, I thought then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Thought! Didst thou not affirm it?</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> I confess, sir,<br />
I did believe so then; but now I hear<br />
My lord's opinion to the contrary,<br />
I am of another faith: for 'tis not fit<br />
That I should contradict him. I am dim, sir;<br />
But he's sharp-sighted.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> This is to my wish.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> We know not what to think of this; yet would not</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni, Hippolito</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonso</span>.</p>

<p>Determine rashly of it. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;How do you like<br />
My nephew's horsemanship?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> In my judgment, sir,<br />
It is exact and rare.</p>

<p><i>Alph.</i> And, to my fancy,<br />
He did present great Alexander mounted<br />
On his Bucephalus.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> You are right, courtiers,<br />
And know it is your duty to cry up<br />
All actions of a prince.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Do not betray<br />
Yourself, you're safe; I have done my part.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Aside to</i></span> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span>.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I thank you;<br />
Nor will I fail.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> What's your opinion, nephew,<br />
Of the horses?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
<i>Giov.</i> Two of them are, in my judgment,<br />
The best I ever back'd; I mean the roan, sir,<br />
And the brown bay: but for the chestnut-colour'd,<br />
Though he be full of metal, hot, and fiery,<br />
He treads weak in his pasterns.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> So: come nearer;<br />
This exercise hath put you into a sweat;<br />
Take this and dry it: and now I command you<br />
To tell me truly what's your censure of<br />
Charomonte's daughter, Lidia.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I am, sir,<br />
A novice in my judgment of a lady;<br />
But such as 'tis, your grace shall have it freely.<br />
I would not speak ill of her, and am sorry,<br />
If I keep myself a friend to truth, I cannot<br />
Report her as I would, so much I owe<br />
Her reverend father: but I'll give you, sir,<br />
As near as I can, her character in little.<br />
She's of a goodly stature, and her limbs<br />
Not disproportion'd; for her face, it is<br />
Far from deformity; yet they flatter her,<br />
That style it excellent: her manners are<br />
Simple and innocent; but her discourse<br />
And wit deserve my pity, more than praise:<br />
At the best, my lord, she is a handsome picture,<br />
And, that said, all is spoken.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> I believe you;<br />
I ne'er yet found you false.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Nor ever shall, sir.&mdash;<br />
Forgive me, matchless Lidia! too much love,<br />
And jealous fear to lose thee, do compel me,<br />
Against my will, my reason, and my knowledge,<br />
To be a poor detractor of that beauty,<br />
Which fluent Ovid, if he lived again,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Would want words to express.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Pray you, make choice of<br />
The richest of our furniture for these horses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>To</i></span> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span>.<br />
And take my nephew with you; we in this<br />
Will follow his directions.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Could I find now<br />
The princess Fiorinda, and persuade her<br />
To be silent in the suit that I moved to her,<br />
All were secure.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> In that, my lord, I'll aid you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> We will be private; leave us.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">[<i>Exeunt all but</i></span> <span class="smcap">Cozimo</span>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">All my studies</span><br />
And serious meditations aim no further<br />
Than this young man's good. He was my sister's son,<br />
And she was such a sister, when she lived,<br />
I could not prize too much; nor can I better<br />
Make known how dear I hold her memory,<br />
Than in my cherishing the only issue<br />
Which she hath left behind her. Who's that?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fiorinda</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> My fair charge! you are welcome to us.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I have found it, sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> All things go well in Urbin.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Your gracious care to me, an orphan, frees me<br />
From all suspicion that my jealous fears<br />
Can drive into my fancy.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> The next summer,<br />
In our own person, we will bring you thither,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
And seat you in your own.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> When you think fit, sir.<br />
But, in the mean time, with your highness' pardon,<br />
I am a suitor to you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Name it, madam,<br />
With confidence to obtain it.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> That you would please<br />
To lay a strict command on Charomonte,<br />
To bring his daughter Lidia to the court:<br />
And pray you, think, sir, that 'tis not my purpose<br />
To employ her as a servant, but to use her<br />
As a most wish'd companion.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Ha! your reason?</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> The hopeful prince, your nephew, sir, hath given her<br />
To me for such an abstract of perfection<br />
In all that can be wish'd for in a virgin,<br />
As beauty, music, ravishing discourse,<br />
Quickness of apprehension, with choice manners<br />
And learning too, not usual with women,<br />
That I am much ambitious (though I shall<br />
Appear but as a foil to set her off)<br />
To be by her instructed, and supplied<br />
In what I am defective.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Did my nephew<br />
Seriously deliver this?</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I assure your grace,<br />
With zeal and vehemency; and, even when,<br />
With his best words, he strived to set her forth,<br />
(Though the rare subject made him eloquent,)<br />
He would complain, all he could say came short<br />
Of her deservings.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Pray you have patience.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Walks aside.</i></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>This was strangely carried.&mdash;Ha! are we trifled with?<br />
Dare they do this? Is Cozimo's fury, that<br />
Of late was terrible, grown contemptible?<br />
Well; we will clear our brows, and undermine<br />
Their secret works, though they have digg'd like moles,<br />
And crush them with the tempest of my wrath<br />
When I appear most calm. He is unfit<br />
To command others that knows not to use it<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>,<br />
And with all rigour: yet my stern looks shall not<br />
Discover my intents; for I will strike<br />
When I begin to frown.&mdash;&mdash;You are the mistress<br />
Of that you did demand.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I thank your highness;<br />
But speed in the performance of the grant<br />
Doubles the favour, sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> You shall possess it<br />
Sooner than you expect:&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Only be pleased to be ready, when my secretary<br />
Waits on you, to take the fresh air. My nephew,<br />
And my bosom friend, so to cheat me! 'tis not fair.<br />

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Where should this princess be? nor in her lodgings,<br />
Nor in the private walks, her own retreat,<br />
Which she so much frequented!</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> By my life,<br />
She's with the duke! and I much more than fear<br />
Her forwardness to prefer my suit hath ruin'd<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
What with such care we built up.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Have you furnish'd<br />
Those coursers, as we will'd you?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> There's no sign<br />
Of anger in his looks.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> They are complete, sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> 'Tis well: to your rest. Soft sleeps wait on you, madam.<br />
To-morrow, with the rising of the sun,<br />
Be ready to ride with us.&mdash;They with more safety<br />
Had trod on fork-tongued adders, than provoked me.
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Aside, and exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I come not to be thank'd, sir, for the speedy<br />
Performance of my promise touching Lidia:<br />
It is effected.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> We are undone.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> The duke<br />
No sooner heard me with my best of language<br />
Describe her excellencies, as you taught me,<br />
But he confirm'd it.&mdash;You look sad, as if<br />
You wish'd it were undone.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> No, gracious madam,<br />
I am your servant for 't.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Be you as careful<br />
For what I moved to you.&mdash;Count Sanazarro,<br />
Now I perceive you honour me, in vouchsafing<br />
To wear so slight a favour.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis a grace<br />
I am unworthy of.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> You merit more,<br />
In prizing so a trifle. Take this diamond;<br />
I'll second what I have begun; for know,<br />
Your valour hath so won upon me, that<br />
'Tis not to be resisted: I have said, sir,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
And leave you to interpret it.
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> This to me<br />
Is wormwood. 'Tis apparent we are taken<br />
In our own noose. What's to be done?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I know not.<br />
And 'tis a punishment justly fallen upon me,<br />
For leaving truth, a constant mistress, that<br />
Ever protects her servants, to become<br />
A slave to lies and falsehood. What excuse<br />
Can we make to the duke, what mercy hope for,<br />
Our packing<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> being laid open?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis not to<br />
Be question'd but his purposed journey is<br />
To see fair Lidia.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> And to divert him<br />
Impossible.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> There's now no looking backward.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> And which way to go on with safety, not<br />
To be imagined.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Give me leave: I have<br />
An embryon in my brain, which, I despair not,<br />
May be brought to form and fashion, provided<br />
You will be open-breasted.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> 'Tis no time now,<br />
Our dangers being equal, to conceal<br />
A thought from you.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> What power hold you o'er Lidia?<br />
Do you think that, with some hazard of her life,<br />
She would prevent your ruin?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I presume so:<br />
If, in the undertaking it, she stray not<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>From what becomes her innocence; and to that<br />
'Tis far from me to press her: I myself<br />
Will rather suffer.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis enough; this night<br />
Write to her by your servant Calandrino,<br />
As I shall give directions; my man</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Calandrino</span>, <i>fantastically dressed.</i></p>

<p>Shall bear him company. See, sir, to my wish<br />
He does appear; but much transform'd from what<br />
He was when he came hither.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> I confess<br />
I am not very wise, and yet I find<br />
A fool, so he be parcel knave, in court<br />
May flourish and grow rich.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Calandrino.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Peace!<br />
I am in contemplation.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Do not you know me?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> I tell thee, no; on forfeit of my place,<br />
I must not know myself, much less my father,<br />
But by petition; that petition lined too<br />
With golden birds, that sing to the tune of profit,<br />
Or I am deaf.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> But you've your sense of feeling.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Offering to strike him.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Nay, pray you, forbear.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> I have all that's requisite<br />
To the making up of a signior: my spruce ruff,<br />
My hooded cloak, long stocking, and paned hose,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>My case of toothpicks, and my silver fork<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>;<br />
To convey an olive neatly to my mouth;&mdash;<br />
And, what is all in all, my pockets ring<br />
A golden peal. O that the peasants in the country,<br />
My quondam fellows, but saw me as I am,<br />
How they would admire and worship me!</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> As they shall;<br />
For instantly you must thither.</p>

<p>Cal. <i>My grand signior,<br />
Vouchsafe a beso las manos<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, and a cringe<br />
Of the last edition.</i></p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> You must ride post with letters<br />
This night to Lidia.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> An it please your grace,<br />
Shall I use my coach, or footcloth mule?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> You widgeon,<br />
You are to make all speed; think not of pomp.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Follow for your instructions, sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> I have<br />
One suit to you, my good lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<i>Sanaz.</i> What is 't?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> That you would give me<br />
A subtile court-charm, to defend me from<br />
The infectious air of the country.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> What's the reason?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Why, as this court-air taught me knavish wit,<br />
By which I am grown rich, if that again<br />
Should turn me fool and honest, vain hopes farewell!<br />
For I must die a beggar.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Go to, sirrah,<br />
You'll be whipt for this.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> Leave fooling, and attend us.

<h3>ACT IV. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Country. A Hall in</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lidia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Daughter, I have observed, since the prince left us,<br />
(Whose absence I mourn with you,) and the visit<br />
Count Sanazarro gave us, you have nourish'd<br />
Sad and retired thoughts, and parted with<br />
That freedom and alacrity of spirit<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
With which you used to cheer me.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> For the count, sir,<br />
All thought of him does with his person die;<br />
But I confess ingenuously, I cannot<br />
So soon forget the choice and chaste delights,<br />
The courteous conversation of the prince,<br />
And without stain, I hope, afforded me,<br />
When he made this house a court.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> It is in us<br />
To keep it so without him. Want we know not,<br />
And all we can complain of, Heaven be praised for 't,<br />
Is too much plenty; and we will make use of</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Caponi, Bernardo, Petruchio</span>, <i>and
other Servants</i>.</p>

<p>All lawful pleasures.&mdash;How now, fellows! when<br />
Shall we have this lusty dance?</p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> In the afternoon, sir.<br />
'Tis a device, I wis, of my own making,<br />
And such a one, as shall make your signiorship know<br />
I have not been your butler for nothing, but<br />
Have crotchets in my head. We'll trip it tightly,<br />
And make my sad young mistress merry again,<br />
Or I'll forswear the cellar.</p>

<p><i>Bern.</i> If we had<br />
Our fellow Calandrino here, to dance<br />
His part, we were perfect.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> O! he was a rare fellow;<br />
But I fear the court hath spoil'd him.</p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> When I was young,<br />
I could have cut a caper on a pinnacle;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>But now I am old and wise.&mdash;Keep your figure fair,<br />
And follow but the sample I shall set you,<br />
The duke himself will send for us, and laugh at us;<br />
And that were credit.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Calandrino</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Who have we here?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> I find<br />
What was brawn in the country, in the court grows tender.<br />
The bots on these jolting jades! I am bruised to jelly.<br />
A coach for my money!</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Calandrino! 'tis he.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Now to my postures.&mdash;Let my hand have the honour<br />
To convey a kiss from my lips to the cover of<br />
Your foot, dear signior.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Fie! you stoop too low, sir.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> The hem of your vestment, lady: your glove is for princes;<br />
Nay, I have conn'd my distances.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> 'Tis most courtly.</p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> Fellow Calandrino!</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Signior de Caponi,<br />
Grand botelier of the mansion.</p>

<p><i>Bern.</i> How is 't, man?
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Claps him on the shoulder.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Be not so rustic in your salutations.<br />
Signior Bernardo, master of the accounts.<br />
Signior Petruchio, may you long continue<br />
Your function in the chamber!</p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> When shall we learn<br />
Such gambols in our villa?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
<i>Lid.</i> Sure he's mad.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> 'Tis not unlike, for most of such mushrooms are so.<br />
What news at court?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> <i>Basta!</i> they are mysteries.<br />
And not to be reveal'd. With your favour, signior,<br />
I am, in private, to confer awhile<br />
With this signora: but I'll pawn my honour,<br />
That neither my terse language, nor my habit,<br />
Howe'er it may convince, nor my new shrugs,<br />
Shall render her enamour'd.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Take your pleasure;<br />
A little of these apish tricks may pass,<br />
Too much is tedious.
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> The prince, in this paper,<br />
Presents his service. Nay, it is not courtly<br />
To see the seal broke open; so I leave you.&mdash;<br />
Signiors of the villa, I'll descend to be<br />
Familiar with you.</p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> Have you forgot to dance?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> No, I am better'd.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Will you join with us?</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> As I like the project.<br />
Let me warm my brains first with the richest grape,<br />
And then I'm for you.</p>

<p><i>Cap.</i> We will want no wine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">[<i>Exeunt all but</i></span> <span class="smcap">Lidia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> That this comes only from the best of princes,<br />
With a kind of adoration does command me<br />
To entertain it; and the sweet contents<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Kissing the letter.</i></span><br />
That are inscribed here by his hand must be<br />
Much more than musical to me. All the service<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>Of my life at no part can deserve this favour.<br />
O, what a virgin longing I feel on me<br />
To unrip the seal, and read it! yet, to break<br />
What he hath fastened, rashly, may appear<br />
A saucy rudeness in me.&mdash;I must do it,<br />
(Nor can I else learn his commands, or serve them,)<br />
But with such reverence, as I would open<br />
Some holy writ, whose grave instructions beat down<br />
Rebellious sins, and teach my better part<br />
How to mount upward.&mdash;So, [<i>opens the letter</i>] 'tis done, and I<br />
With eagle's eyes will curiously peruse it.

Who would not perish? Virtue in him must suffer,<br />
And piety be forgotten. The duke's passion,<br />

Though it raged more than Tarquin's, shall not reach me.<br />
All quaint inventions of chaste virgins aid me!<br />
My prayers are heard; I have 't. The duke ne'er saw me&mdash;<br />
Or, if that fail, I am again provided&mdash;<br />
But for the servants!&mdash;They will take what form<br />
I please to put upon them. Giovanni,<br />
Be safe; thy servant Lidia assures it.<br />
Let mountains of afflictions fall on me,<br />
Their weight is easy, so I set thee free.

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Another Room in the same.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cozimo, Giovanni, Sanazarro, Charomonte</span>,
<i>and Attendants</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Are you not tired with travel, sir?</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> No, no;<br />
I am fresh and lusty.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> This day shall be ever<br />
A holiday to me, that brings my prince<br />
Under my humble roof.
<span style="margin-left:6em;">[<i>Weeps.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> See, sir, my good tutor<br />
Sheds tears for joy.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Dry them up, Charomonte;<br />
And all forbear the room, while we exchange<br />
Some private words together.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> O, my lord,<br />
How grossly have we overshot ourselves!</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> In what, sir?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> In forgetting to acquaint<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>My guardian with our purpose: all that Lidia<br />
Can do avails us nothing, if the duke<br />
Find out the truth from him.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis now past help,<br />
And we must stand the hazard:&mdash;hope the best, sir.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni, Sanazarro</span>, <i>and Attendants</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Char.</i> My loyalty doubted, sir!</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> 'Tis more. Thou hast<br />
Abused our trust, and in a high degree<br />
Committed treason.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Treason! 'Tis a word<br />
My innocence understands not. Were my breast<br />
Transparent, and my thoughts to be discern'd,<br />
Not one spot shall be found to taint the candour<br />
Of my allegiance: and I must be bold<br />
To tell you, sir, (for he that knows no guilt<br />
Can know no fear,) 'tis tyranny to o'ercharge<br />
An honest man; and such, till now, I've lived,<br />
And such, my lord, I'll die.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Sir, do not flatter<br />
Yourself with hope, these great and glorious words,<br />
Which every guilty wretch, as well as you,<br />
That's arm'd with impudence, can with ease deliver,<br />
And with as full a mouth, can work on us:<br />
Nor shall gay flourishes of language clear<br />
What is in fact apparent.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Fact! what fact?<br />
You, that know only what it is, instruct me,<br />
For I am ignorant.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> This, then, sir: We gave up,<br />
On our assurance of your faith and care,<br />
Our nephew Giovanni, nay, our heir<br />
In expectation, to be train'd up by you<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
As did become a prince.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And I discharged it:<br />
Is this the treason?</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Take us with you, sir<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.<br />
And, in respect we knew his youth was prone<br />
To women, and that, living in our court,<br />
He might make some unworthy choice, before<br />
His weaker judgment was confirm'd, we did<br />
Remove him from it; constantly presuming,<br />
You, with your best endeavours, rather would<br />
Have quench'd those heats in him, than light a torch,<br />
As you have done, to his looseness.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I! my travail<br />
Is ill requited, sir; for, by my soul,<br />
I was so curious that way, that I granted<br />
Access to none could tempt him; nor did ever<br />
One syllable, or obscene accent, touch<br />
His ear, that might corrupt him.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> No! Why, then,<br />
With your allowance, did you give free way<br />
To all familiar privacy between<br />
My nephew and your daughter? Or why did you<br />
(Had you no other ends in 't but our service)<br />
Read to them, and together, as they had been<br />
Scholars of one form, grammar, rhetoric,<br />
Philosophy, story<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>, and interpret to them<br />
The close temptations of lascivious poets?<br />
Or wherefore, for we still had spies upon you,<br />
Was she still present, when, by your advice,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>He was taught the use of his weapon, horsemanship,<br />
Nay, wrestling, but to fan a love in her?<br />
And then, forsooth, his exercises ended,<br />
A fair pretence of recreation for him,<br />
(When Lidia was instructed in those graces<br />
That add to beauty,) he, brought to admire her,<br />
Must hear her sing, while to her voice her hand<br />
Made ravishing music; and, this applauded, dance<br />
A light lavolta<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> with her.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Have you ended<br />
All you can charge me with?</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Nor stopt you there,<br />
But they must unattended walk into<br />
The silent groves, and hear the amorous birds<br />
Warbling their wanton notes; here, a sure shade<br />
Of barren sicamores, which the all-seeing sun<br />
Could not pierce through; near that, an arbour hung<br />
With spreading eglantine; there, a bubbling spring<br />
Watering a bank of hyacinths and lilies;<br />
With all allurements that could move to love.<br />
And could this, Charomonte, (should I grant<br />
They had been equals both in birth and fortune,)<br />
Become your gravity? nay, 'tis clear as air,<br />
That your ambitious hopes to match your daughter<br />
Into our family, gave connivance to it:<br />
And this, though not in act, in the intent<br />
I call high treason.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Hear my just defence, sir;<br />
And, though you are my prince, it will not take from<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>Your greatness, to acknowledge with a blush,<br />
In this my accusation you have been<br />
More sway'd by spleen, and jealous suppositions,<br />
Than certain grounds of reason. You had a father,<br />
(Blest be his memory!) that made frequent proofs<br />
Of my loyalty and faith, and, would I boast<br />
The dangers I have broke through in his service,<br />
I could say more. Nay, you yourself, dread sir,<br />
Whenever I was put unto the test,<br />
Found me true gold, and not adulterate metal;<br />
And am I doubted now?</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> This is from the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I will come to it, sir: Your grace well knew,<br />
Before the prince's happy presence made<br />
My poor house rich, the chiefest blessing which<br />
I gloried in, though now it prove a curse,<br />
Was an only daughter. Nor did you command me,<br />
As a security to your future fears,<br />
To cast her off: which had you done, howe'er<br />
She was the light of my eyes, and comfort of<br />
My feeble age, so far I prized my duty<br />
Above affection, she now had been<br />
A stranger to my care. But she is fair!<br />
Is that her fault, or mine? Did ever father<br />
Hold beauty in his issue for a blemish?<br />
You may, if you think fit, before my face,<br />
In recompense of all my watchings for you,<br />
With burning corrosives transform her to<br />
An ugly leper. This I will rather suffer, sir,<br />
Than live suspected by you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Let not passion<br />
Carry you beyond your reason.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I am calm, sir;<br />
Yet you must give me leave to grieve I find<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>My actions misinterpreted. Alas! sir,<br />
Was Lidia's desire to serve the prince<br />
Call'd an offence? or did she practise to<br />
Seduce his youth, because with her best zeal<br />
And fervour she endeavour'd to attend him?<br />
'Tis a hard construction. Though she be my daughter,<br />
I may thus far speak her: from her infancy<br />
She was ever civil, her behaviour nearer<br />
Simplicity than craft; and malice dares not<br />
Affirm, in one loose gesture, or light language,<br />
She gave a sign she was in thought unchaste.<br />
I'll fetch her to you, sir; and but look on her<br />
With equal eyes, you must in justice grant<br />
That your suspicion wrongs her.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> It may be;<br />
But I must have stronger assurance of it<br />
Than passionate words: and, not to trifle time,<br />
As we came unexpected to your house,<br />
We will prevent all means that may prepare her<br />
How to answer that with which we come to charge her.<br />
And howsoever it may be received<br />
As a foul breach to hospitable rites,<br />
On thy allegiance and boasted faith,<br />
Nay, forfeit of thy head, we do confine thee<br />
Close prisoner to thy chamber till all doubts<br />
Are clear'd that do concern us.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I obey, sir,<br />
And wish your grace had followed my hearse<br />
To my sepulchre, my loyalty unsuspected,<br />
Rather than now&mdash;&mdash;But I am silent, sir,<br />
And let that speak my duty<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Bring Lidia forth.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> She comes, sir, of herself,<br />
To present her service to you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Ha! This personage<br />
Cannot invite affection.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> See you keep state.</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> The manners of her mind<br />
Must be transcendent, if they can defend<br />
Her rougher outside. May we with your liking<br />
Salute you, lady?</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> Let me wipe my mouth, sir,<br />
With my cambric handkerchief, and then have at you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Can this be possible?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Yes, sir; you will find her<br />
Such as I gave her to you.</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> Will your dukeship<br />
Sit down and eat some sugar-plums? Here's a castle<br />
Of march-pane<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> too; and this quince-marmalade was<br />
Of my own making; all summ'd up together,<br />
Did cost the setting on: and here is wine too,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>As good as e'er was tapp'd. I'll be your taster,<br />
For I know the fashion. [<i>Drinks all off.</i>]&mdash;Now you must do me right, sir;<br />
You shall nor will nor choose.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> She's very simple.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Simple! 'tis worse. Do you drink thus often, lady?</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> Still when I am thirsty, and eat when I am hungry:<br />
Such junkets come not every day. Once more to you,<br />
With a heart and a half, i' faith.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Pray you, pause a little.</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> Then I'll drink for you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> I'll find you out a pledge<br />
That shall supply my place: what think you of<br />
This complete signior? You are a Juno,<br />
And in such state must feast this Jupiter:<br />
What think you of him?</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> I desire no better.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> And you will undertake this service for me?<br />
You are good at the sport.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> Who, I? a piddler, sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Nay, you shall sit enthroned, and eat and drink<br />
As you were a duke.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> If your grace will have me,<br />
I'll eat and drink like an emperor.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Take your place, then:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">[<span class="smcap">Calandrino</span> <i>takes the duke's chair</i>.</span><br />
We are amazed.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> This is gross; nor can the imposture<br />

To be deluded thus.<br />
<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>Or divide, and I will choose. Cannot you use<br />
Your fork, as I do? Gape, and I will feed you.<br />

<p><i>Petron.</i> To choke daws with:&mdash;&mdash;<br />
I like it not.</p>

<p><i>Cal.</i> But you like this?</p>

<p><i>Petron.</i> Let it come, boy.

<p><i>Coz.</i> What a sight is this! We could be angry with you.<br />
How much you did belie her when you told us<br />
She was only simple! this is barbarous rudeness,<br />
Beyond belief.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> I would not speak her, sir,<br />

For it is of several colours, we must borrow<br />

In a daughter, nay, a monster. Good old man!&mdash;<br />

<p><i>Coz.</i> These are strange chimeras to us: what to judge of 't,<br />

<p><i>Coz.</i> Is this your only daughter?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And my heir, sir;<br />
Nor keep I any woman in my house<br />
(Unless for sordid offices) but one<br />
I do maintain, trimm'd up in her cast habits,<br />
To make her sport: and she, indeed, loves wine,<br />
And will take too much of it; and, perhaps, for mirth,<br />
She was presented to you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> It shall yield<br />
No sport to the contrivers. 'Tis too plain now.<br />
Her presence does confirm what Contarino<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Deliver'd of her; nor can sickness dim<br />
The splendour of her beauties: being herself, then,<br />
She must exceed his praise.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Will your grace hear me?<br />
I'm faint, and can say little.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Here are accents<br />
Whose every syllable is musical!<br />
Pray you, let me raise you, and awhile rest here.<br />
False Sanazarro, treacherous Giovanni!<br />
But stand we talking!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Here's a storm soon raised.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> As thou art our subject, Charomonte, swear<br />
To act what we command.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> That is an oath<br />
I long since took.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Then, by that oath we charge thee,<br />
Without excuse, denial, or delay,<br />
To apprehend, and suddenly, Sanazarro,<br />
And our ingrateful nephew. We have said it.<br />
Do it without reply, or we pronounce thee,<br />
Like them, a traitor to us. See them guarded<br />
In several lodgings, and forbid access<br />
To all, but when we warrant. Is our will<br />
Heard sooner than obey'd?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> These are strange turns;<br />

Before I'll make petition to your greatness,<br />
But with such reverence, my hands held up thus,<br />

<p><i>Coz.</i> Here's that form<br />
Of language I expected; pray you, speak:<br />
What is your suit?</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> That you look upon me<br />
As an humble thing, that millions of degrees<br />
Is placed beneath you: for what am I, dread sir,<br />
Or what can fall in the whole course of my life,<br />
That may be worth your care, much less your trouble?<br />
As the lowly shrub is to the lofty cedar,<br />
Or a molehill to Olympus, if compared,<br />
I am to you, sir. Or, suppose the prince,<br />
(Which cannot find belief in me,) forgetting<br />
The greatness of his birth and hopes, hath thrown<br />
An eye of favour on me, in me punish,<br />
That am the cause, the rashness of his youth.<br />
Shall the queen of the inhabitants of the air,<br />
The eagle, that bears thunder on her wings,<br />
In her angry mood destroy her hopeful young,<br />
For suffering a wren to perch too near them?<br />
Such is our disproportion.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> With what fervour<br />
She pleads against herself!</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> For me, poor maid,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>I know the prince to be so far above me,<br />
That my wishes cannot reach him. Yet I am<br />
So much his creature, that, to fix him in<br />
Your wonted grace and favour, I'll abjure<br />
His sight for ever, and betake myself<br />
To a religious life, (where in my prayers<br />
I may remember him,) and ne'er see man more,<br />
But my ghostly father. Will you trust me, sir?<br />
In truth I'll keep my word; or, if this fail,<br />
A little more of fear what may befall him<br />
Will stop my breath for ever.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Had you thus argued
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Raises her.</i></span><br />
As you were yourself, and brought as advocates<br />
Your health and beauty to make way for you,<br />
No crime of his could put on such a shape<br />
But I should look with the eyes of mercy on it.<br />
What would I give to see this diamond<br />
In her perfect lustre, as she was before<br />
The clouds of sickness dimm'd it! Yet, take comfort;<br />
And, as you would obtain remission for<br />
His treachery to me, cheer your drooping spirits,<br />
And call the blood again into your cheeks,<br />
And then plead for him; and in such a habit<br />
As in your highest hopes you would put on,<br />
If we were to receive you for our bride.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> I'll do my best, sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> And that best will be<br />
A crown of all felicity to me.

<h3>ACT V. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. An upper Chamber in</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis proved in me: the curse of human frailty,<br />
Adding to our afflictions, makes us know<br />
What's good; and yet our violent passions force us<br />
To follow what is ill. Reason assured me<br />
It was not safe to shave a lion's skin;<br />
And that to trifle with a sovereign was<br />
To play with lightning: yet imperious beauty,<br />
Treading upon the neck of understanding,<br />
Compell'd me to put off my natural shape<br />
Of loyal duty, to disguise myself<br />
In the adulterate and cobweb-mask<br />
Of disobedient treachery. Where is now<br />
My borrow'd greatness, or the promised lives<br />
Of following courtiers echoing my will?<br />
In a moment vanish'd! Power that stands not on<br />
Its proper base, which is peculiar only<br />
To absolute princes, falls or rises with<br />
Their frown or favour. The great duke, my master,<br />
(Who almost changed me to his other self,)<br />
No sooner takes his beams of comfort from me,<br />
But I, as one unknown, or unregarded,<br />
Unpitied suffer. Who makes intercession<br />
To his mercy for me now? who does remember<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>The service I have done him? not a man:<br />
And such as spake no language but my lord<br />
The favourite of Tuscany's grand duke,<br />
Deride my madness.&mdash;Ha! what noise of horses?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>He looks out at the back window.</i></span><br />
A goodly troop! This back part of my prison<br />
Allows me liberty to see and know them.<br />
Contarino! yes, 'tis he, and Lodovico<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>:<br />
And the duchess Fiorinda, Urbin's heir,<br />
A princess I have slighted: yet I wear<br />
Her favours; and, to teach me what I am,<br />
She whom I scorn'd can only mediate for me.<br />
This way she makes, yet speak to her I dare not;<br />
And how to make suit to her is a task<br />
Of as much difficulty.&mdash;Yes, thou blessed pledge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Takes off the ring.</i></span><br />
Of her affection, aid me! This supplies<br />
The want of pen and ink; and this, of paper.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Takes a pane of glass.</i></span><br />
It must be so; and I in my petition<br />
Concise and pithy.

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Court before</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Contarino</span>, <i>leading in</i> <span class="smcap">Fiorinda, Alphonso,
Hippolito, Hieronimo</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Calaminta</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> 'Tis a goodly pile, this.</p>

<p><i>Hier.</i> But better by the owner.</p>

<p><i>Alph.</i> But most rich<br />
In the great states<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> it covers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<i>Fior.</i> The duke's pleasure<br />
Commands us hither.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Which was laid on us<br />
To attend you to it.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Signior Charomonte,<br />
To see your excellence his guest, will think<br />
Himself most happy.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Tie my shoe.&mdash;[<i>The pane falls down.</i>]&mdash;What's that?<br />
A pane thrown from the window, no wind stirring!</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> And at your feet too fall'n:&mdash;there's something writ on 't.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Some courtier, belike, would have it known<br />
He wore a diamond.</p>

<p><i>Calam.</i> Ha! it is directed<br />
To the princess Fiorinda.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> We will read it.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Reads.</i></span></p>

<p>Of me the most beloved; and I will save thee,<br />
Or perish with thee. Sure, thy fault must be<br />
Of some prodigious shape, if that my prayers<br />
And humble intercession to the duke</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cozimo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Charomonte</span>.</p>

<p>Prevail not with him. Here he comes; delay<br />
Shall not make less my benefit.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> What we purpose<br />
Shall know no change, and therefore move we not:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>We were made as properties, and what we shall<br />
Determine of them cannot be call'd rigour,<br />
But noble justice. When they proved disloyal,<br />
They were cruel to themselves. The prince that pardons<br />
The first affront offer'd to majesty,<br />
Invites a second, rendering that power<br />
Subjects should tremble at, contemptible.<br />
Ingratitude is a monster, Carolo,<br />
To be strangled in the birth, not to be cherish'd.<br />
Madam, you're happily met with.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Sir, I am<br />
An humble suitor to you; and the rather<br />
Am confident of a grant, in that your grace,<br />
When I made choice to be at your devotion,<br />
Vow'd to deny me nothing.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> To this minute<br />
We have confirm'd it. What's your boon?</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> It is, sir,<br />
That you, in being gracious to your servant,<br />
The ne'er sufficiently praised Sanazarro,<br />
That now under your heavy displeasure suffers,<br />
Would be good unto yourself. His services,<br />
So many, and so great, (your storm of fury<br />
Calm'd by your better judgment,) must inform you<br />
Some little slip, for sure it is no more,<br />
From his loyal duty, with your justice cannot<br />
Make foul his fair deservings. Great sir, therefore,<br />
Look backward on his former worth, and turning<br />
Your eye from his offence, what 'tis I know not,<br />
And, I am confident, you will receive him<br />
Once more into your favour.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> You say well,<br />
You are ignorant in the nature of his fault;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Which when you understand, as we'll instruct you,<br />
Your pity will appear a charity,<br />
It being conferr'd on an unthankful man,<br />
To be repented. He's a traitor, madam,<br />
To you, to us, to gratitude; and in that<br />
All crimes are comprehended.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> If his offence<br />
Aim'd at me only, whatsoe'er it is,<br />
'Tis freely pardon'd.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> This compassion in you<br />
Must make the colour of his guilt more ugly.<br />
The honours we have hourly heap'd upon him,<br />
The titles, the rewards, to the envy of<br />
The old nobility, as the common people,<br />
We now forbear to touch at, and will only<br />
Insist on his gross wrongs to you. You were pleased,<br />
Forgetting both yourself and proper greatness,<br />
To favour him, nay, to court him to embrace<br />
A happiness, which, on his knees, with joy<br />
He should have sued for. Who repined not at<br />
The grace you did him? yet, in recompense<br />
Of your large bounties, the disloyal wretch<br />
Makes you a stale; and, what he might be by you,<br />
Scorn'd and derided, gives himself up wholly<br />
To the service of another. If you can<br />
Bear this with patience, we must say you have not<br />
The bitterness of spleen, or ireful passions<br />
Familiar to women. Pause upon it,<br />
And when you seriously have weigh'd his carriage,<br />
Move us again, if your reason will allow it,<br />
His treachery known: and then, if you continue<br />
An advocate for him, we perhaps, because<br />
We would deny you nothing, may awake<br />
Our sleeping mercy. Carolo!</p>

<i>Char.</i> My lord.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>They talk aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> To endure a rival that were equal to me,<br />
Cannot but speak my poverty of spirit;<br />
But an inferior, more: yet true love must not<br />
Know or degrees, or distances. Lidia may be<br />
As far above me in her form, as she<br />
Is in her birth beneath me; and what I<br />
In Sanazarro liked, he loves in her.<br />
But, if I free him now, the benefit<br />
Being done so timely, and confirming too<br />
My strength and power, my soul's best faculties being<br />
Bent wholly to preserve him, must supply me<br />
With all I am defective in, and bind him<br />
My creature ever. It must needs be so,<br />
Nor will I give it o'er thus.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Does your nephew<br />
Bear his restraint so constantly<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>, as you<br />
Deliver it to us?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> In my judgment, sir,<br />
He suffers more for his offence to you,<br />
Than in his fear of what can follow it.<br />
For he is so collected, and prepared<br />
To welcome that you shall determine of him,<br />
As if his doubts and fears were equal to him.<br />
And sure he's not acquainted with much guilt,<br />
That more laments the telling one untruth,<br />
Under your pardon still, for 'twas a fault, sir,<br />
Than others, that pretend to conscience, do<br />
Their crying secret sins.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> No more; this gloss<br />
Defends not the corruption of the text.<br />
Urge it no more.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">[<span class="smcap">Charomonte</span> <i>and the others talk aside</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I once more must make bold, sir,<br />
To trench upon your patience. I have<br />
Consider'd my wrongs duly: yet that cannot<br />
Divert my intercession for a man<br />
Your grace, like me, once favour'd. I am still<br />
A suppliant to you, that you would vouchsafe<br />
The hearing his defence, and that I may,<br />
With your allowance, see and comfort him.<br />
Then, having heard all that he can allege<br />
In his excuse, for being false to you,<br />
Censure him as you please.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> You will o'ercome;<br />
There's no contending with you. Pray you, enjoy<br />
What you desire, and tell him, he shall have<br />
A speedy trial; in which, we will forbear<br />
To sit a judge, because our purpose is<br />
To rise up his accuser.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> All increase<br />
Of happiness wait on Cozimo!<br />

<p><i>Alph.</i> Was it no more?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> My honour's pawn'd for it.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> I'll second you.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Since it is for the service and the safety<br />
Of the hopeful prince, fall what can fall, I'll run<br />
The desperate hazard.</p>

<p><i>Hier.</i> He's no friend to virtue<br />
That does decline it.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">[<i>They all come forward and kneel.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Ha! what sue you for?<br />
Shall we be ever troubled? Do not tempt<br />
That anger may consume you.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Let it, sir:<br />
The loss is less, though innocents we perish,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Than that your sister's son should fall, unheard,<br />
Under your fury. Shall we fear to entreat<br />
That grace for him, that are your faithful servants,<br />
Which you vouchsafe the count, like us a subject?</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Did not we vow, till sickness had forsook<br />
Thy daughter Lidia, and she appear'd<br />
In her perfect health and beauty to plead for him,<br />
We were deaf to all persuasion?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And that hope, sir,<br />
Hath wrought a miracle. She is recover'd,<br />
And, if you please to warrant her, will bring<br />
The penitent prince before you.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> To enjoy<br />
Such happiness, what would we not dispense with?</p>

<p><i>Alph. Hip. Hier.</i> We all kneel for the prince.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> Nor can it stand<br />
With your mercy, that are gracious to strangers,<br />
To be cruel to your own.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> But art thou certain<br />
I shall behold her at the best?</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> If ever<br />
She was handsome, as it fits not me to say so,<br />
She is now much better'd.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Rise; thou art but dead,<br />
If this prove otherwise. Lidia, appear,<br />
And feast an appetite almost pined to death<br />
With longing expectation to behold<br />
Thy excellencies: thou, as beauty's queen,<br />
Shalt censure<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the detractors. Let my nephew<br />
Be led in triumph under her command;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>We'll have it so; and Sanazarro tremble<br />
To think whom he hath slander'd. We'll retire<br />
Ourselves a little, and prepare to meet<br />
A blessing, which imagination tells us<br />
We are not worthy of: and then come forth,<br />
But with such reverence, as if I were<br />
Myself the priest, the sacrifice my heart,<br />
To offer at the altar of that goodness<br />
That must or kill or save me.

<p><i>Char.</i> Are not these<br />
Strange gambols in the duke?</p>

<p><i>Alph.</i> Great princes have,<br />
Like meaner men, their weakness.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> And may use it<br />
Without control or check.</p>

<p><i>Cont.</i> 'Tis fit they should;<br />
Their privilege were less else, than their subjects'.</p>

<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A State-room in the same.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fiorinda, Sanazarro</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Calaminta</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> And can it be, your bounties should fall down<br />
In showers on my ingratitude, or the wrongs<br />
Your greatness should revenge, teach you to pity?<br />
What retribution can I make, what service<br />
Pay to your goodness, that, in some proportion,<br />
May to the world express I would be thankful?<br />
Since my engagements are so great, that all<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>My best endeavours to appear your creature<br />
Can but proclaim my wants, and what I owe<br />
To your magnificence.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> All debts are discharged<br />
In this acknowledgment: yet, since you please<br />
I shall impose some terms of satisfaction<br />
For that which you profess yourself obliged for,<br />
They shall be gentle ones, and such as will not,<br />
I hope, afflict you.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> Make me understand,<br />
Great princess, what they are, and my obedience<br />
Shall, with all cheerful willingness, subscribe<br />
To what you shall command.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I will bind you to<br />
Make good your promise. First, I then enjoin you<br />
To love a lady, that, a noble way,<br />
Truly affects you; and that you would take<br />
To your protection and care the dukedom<br />
Of Urbin, which no more is mine, but yours.<br />
And that, when you have full possession of<br />
My person as my fortune, you would use me,<br />
Not as a princess, but instruct me in<br />
The duties of an humble wife, for such,<br />
The privilege of my birth no more remember'd,<br />
I will be to you. This consented to,<br />
All injuries are forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> I am wretched,<br />
In having but one life to be employ'd<br />
As you please to dispose it. And, believe it,<br />
If it be not already forfeited<br />
To the fury of my prince, as 'tis your gift,<br />
With all the faculties of my soul I'll study,<br />
In what I may, to serve you.</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I am happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lidia</span>.</p>

<p>In this assurance. What sweet lady's this?</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> 'Tis Lidia, madam, she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> I understand you.<br />
Nay, blush not; by my life, she is a rare one!<br />
And, if I were your judge, I would not blame you<br />
To like and love her. But, sir, you are mine now;<br />
And I presume so on your constancy,<br />
That I dare not be jealous.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> All thoughts of her<br />
Are in your goodness buried.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Pray you, sir,<br />
Be comforted; your innocence should not know<br />
What 'tis to fear; and if that you but look on<br />
The guards that you have in yourself, you cannot.<br />
The duke's your uncle, sir, and, though a little<br />
Incensed against you, when he sees your sorrow,<br />
He must be reconciled. What rugged Tartar,<br />
Or cannibal, though bathed in human gore,<br />
But, looking on your sweetness, would forget<br />
His cruel nature, and let fall his weapon,<br />
Though then aim'd at your throat?</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> O Lidia,<br />
Of maids the honour, and your sex's glory!<br />
It is not fear to die, but to lose you,<br />
That brings this fever on me. I will now<br />
Discover to you, that which, till this minute,<br />
I durst not trust the air with. Ere you knew<br />
What power the magic of your beauty had,<br />
I was enchanted by it, liked, and loved it,<br />
My fondness still increasing with my years;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>And, flatter'd by false hopes, I did attend<br />
Some blessed opportunity to move<br />
The duke with his consent to make you mine:<br />
But now, such is my star-cross'd destiny,<br />
When he beholds you as you are, I may<br />
As well entreat him give away his crown,<br />
As to part from a jewel of more value.<br />
Yet, howsoever, when you are his duchess,<br />
And I am turn'd into forgotten dust,<br />
Pray you, love my memory:&mdash;I should say more,<br />
But I'm cut off.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cozimo, Charomonte, Contarino,
Hieronimo, Hippolito</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Alphonso</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> The duke! That countenance, once,<br />
When it was clothed in smiles, show'd like an angel's,<br />
But, now 'tis folded up in clouds of fury,<br />
'Tis terrible to look on.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> Sir.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> A while<br />
Silence your musical tongue, and let me feast<br />
My eyes with the most ravishing object that<br />
They ever gazed on. There's no miniature<br />
In her fair face, but is a copious theme<br />
Which would, discoursed at large of, make a volume.<br />
What clear arch'd brows! what sparkling eyes! the lilies<br />
Contending with the roses in her cheeks,<br />
Who shall most set them off. What ruby lips!&mdash;<br />
Or unto what can I compare her neck,<br />
But to a rock of crystal? every limb<br />
Proportion'd to love's wish, and in their neatness<br />
Add lustre to the riches of her habit,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Not borrow from it.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> You are pleased to show, sir,<br />
The fluency of your language, in advancing<br />
A subject much unworthy.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> How! unworthy?<br />
By all the vows which lovers offer at<br />
The Cyprian goddess' altars, eloquence<br />
Itself presuming, as you are, to speak you,<br />
Would be struck dumb!&mdash;And what have you deserved then,
[<span class="smcap">Giovanni</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span> <i>kneel</i>.<br />
(Wretches, you kneel too late,) that have endeavour'd<br />
To spout the poison of your black detraction<br />
On this immaculate whiteness? Was it malice<br />
To her perfections? or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Your highness promised<br />
A gracious hearing to the count.</p>

<p><i>Lid.</i> And prince too:<br />
Do not make void so just a grant.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> We will not:<br />
Yet, since their accusation must be urged,<br />
And strongly, ere their weak defence have hearing,<br />
We seat you here, as judges, to determine<br />
Of your gross wrongs and ours. [<i>Seats the Ladies in the chairs of state.</i>] And now, remembering<br />
Whose deputies you are, be neither sway'd<br />
Or with particular spleen, or foolish pity,<br />
For neither can become you.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> There's some hope yet,<br />
Since they have such gentle judges.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Rise, and stand forth, then,<br />
And hear, with horror to your guilty souls,<br />
What we will prove against you. Could this princess,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>Thou enemy to thyself, [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sanazarro</span>.] stoop her high flight<br />
Of towering greatness to invite thy lowness<br />
To look up to it, and with nimble wings<br />
Of gratitude couldst thou forbear to meet it?<br />
Were her favours boundless in a noble way,<br />
And warranted by our allowance, yet,<br />
In thy acceptation, there appear'd no sign<br />
Of a modest thankfulness?</p>

<p><i>Fior.</i> Pray you, forbear<br />
To press that further; 'tis a fault we have<br />
Already heard, and pardon'd.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> We will then<br />
Pass over it, and briefly touch at that<br />
Which does concern ourself; in which both being<br />
Equal offenders, what we shall speak points<br />
Indifferently at either. How we raised thee,<br />
Forgetful Sanazarro! of our grace,<br />
To a full possession of power and honours,<br />
It being too well known, we'll not remember.<br />
And what thou wert, rash youth, in expectation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span>.</span><br />
And from which headlong thou hast thrown thyself,<br />
Not Florence, but all Tuscany, can witness<br />
With admiration. To assure thy hopes,<br />
We did keep constant to a widow'd bed,<br />
And did deny ourself those lawful pleasures<br />
Our absolute power and height of blood allow'd us;<br />
Made both, the keys that open'd our heart's secrets,<br />
And what you spake, believed as oracles:<br />
But you, in recompense of this, to him<br />
That gave you all, to whom you owed your being,<br />
With treacherous lies endeavour'd to conceal<br />
This jewel from our knowledge, which ourself<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Could only lay just claim to.</p>

<p><i>Giov.</i> 'Tis most true, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sanaz.</i> We both confess a guilty cause.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> Look on her.<br />
Is this a beauty fit to be embraced<br />
By any subject's arms? can any tire<br />
Become that forehead but a diadem?<br />
Or, should we grant your being false to us<br />
Could be excused, your treachery to her,<br />
In seeking to deprive her of that greatness<br />
(Her matchless worth consider'd) she was born to,<br />
Must ne'er find pardon. We have spoken, ladies,<br />
Like a rough orator, that brings more truth<br />
Than rhetoric to make good his accusation;<br />
And now expect your sentence.<br />

You were mark'd out the judge of life and death,<br />

A prince much more than rigour.</p>

And therefore with more boldness venture on it:<br />
And, would not our consent to your demands<br />
Deprive us of a happiness hereafter<br />
Ever to be despair'd of, we, perhaps,<br />
Might hearken nearer to you; and could wish<br />
With some qualification, or excuse,<br />
You might make less the mountains of your crimes,<br />
And so invite our clemency to feast with you.<br />
But you, that knew with what impatiency<br />
Of grief we parted from the fair Clarinda,<br />
Our duchess, (let her memory still be sacred!)<br />
And with what imprecations on ourself<br />
We vow'd, not hoping e'er to see her equal,<br />
Ne'er to make trial of a second choice,<br />
If nature framed not one that did excel her,<br />
As this maid's beauty prompts us that she does:&mdash;<br />
And yet, with oaths then mix'd with tears, upon<br />
Her monument we swore our eye should never<br />
Again be tempted;&mdash;'tis true, and those vows<br />
Are register'd above, something here tells me.&mdash;<br />
Carolo, thou heard'st us swear.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> And swear so deeply,<br />
That if all women's beauties were in this,<br />
(As she's not to be named with the dead duchess,)<br />
Nay, all their virtues bound up in one story,<br />
(Of which mine is scarce an epitome,)<br />
If you should take her as a wife, the weight<br />
Of your perjuries would sink you. If I durst,<br />
I had told you this before.</p>

<p><i>Coz.</i> 'Tis strong truth, Carolo:<br />
And yet what was necessity in us<br />
Cannot free them from treason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span><i>Char.</i> There's your error:<br />

We pardon thee; and take from us, in this,<br />
More than our dukedom: love her. As I part<br />

<h2><a name="THE_BONDMAN" id="THE_BONDMAN">THE BONDMAN.</a></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>The Bondman was performed, as we learn from the Office-book
of Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels, at the Cockpit
in Drury-lane, December 3, 1623. It was printed the following
year, and again in 1638.</p>

<p>The main incident of the plot is taken from the life of Timoleon,
as related by Plutarch. The revolt and subsequent reduction
of the slaves to their duty may have been taken either from
Herodotus or Justin, or Purchas's Pilgrim. The artifice by
which they are quelled is silly and unnatural, and its introduction
degrades a very beautifully managed plot.</p>

<p>The play was revived in 1660 by Betterton, who played
Pisander; and several alterations of it have since been produced,
but without success.</p>

<p>Our author never writes with more effect than when he combines
his own fancy with real history; and in The Bondman
he has produced a piece which is, with few exceptions, at once
stately and playful, impressive and tender. He matures the
love under the cover of the history; till at length the interest
changes, and the history becomes subordinate to the love.</p>

<p>The characters are drawn with much variety and interest.
The modest gravity and self-command of Timoleon well agrees
with the ancient descriptions of the man from whose mouth
<i>nihil unquam insolens, neque gloriosum exiit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>

<p class="center"><small>TO</small></p>

<p class="center"><small>THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, MY SINGULAR GOOD LORD,</small></p>

<p class="center">PHILIP, EARL OF MONTGOMERY,</p>

<p class="center"><small>KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER, &amp;C.</small></p>

<p><small>RIGHT HONOURABLE,</small></p>

<p>However I could never arrive at the happiness to be made
known to your lordship, yet a desire, born with me, to make a
tender of all duties and service to the noble family of the Herberts,
descended to me as an inheritance from my dead father,
Arthur Massinger. Many years he happily spent in the service
of your honourable house, and died a servant to it; leaving his
to be ever most glad and ready to be at the command of all such
as derive themselves from his most honoured master, your lordship's
most noble father. The consideration of this encouraged
me (having no other means to present my humblest service to
your honour) to shroud this trifle under the wings of your noble
protection; and I hope, out of the clemency of your heroic disposition,
it will find, though perhaps not a welcome entertainment,
yet, at the worst, a gracious pardon. When it was first
acted, your lordship's liberal suffrage taught others to allow it
for current, it having received the undoubted stamp of your
lordship's allowance: and if in the perusal of any vacant hour,
when your honour's more serious occasions shall give you
leave to read it, it answer, in your lordship's judgment, the
report and opinion it had upon the stage, I shall esteem my
labours not ill employed, and, while I live, continue</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 4em;">the humblest of those that</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">truly honour your lordship,</span><br />
PHILIP MASSINGER.</p></blockquote>

<h3>ACT I. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Camp of</i> <span class="smcap">Timoleon</span>, <i>near Syracuse</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Timagoras</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span>.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Why should you droop, Leosthenes, or despair<br />
My sister's favour? What, before, you purchased<br />
By courtship and fair language, in these wars<br />
(For from her soul you know she loves a soldier)<br />
You may deserve by action.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Good Timagoras,<br />
When I have said my friend, think all is spoken<br />
That may assure me yours; and pray you believe,<br />
The dreadful voice of war that shakes the city,<br />
The thundering threats of Carthage, nor their army<br />
Raised to make good those threats, affright not me.&mdash;<br />
If fair Cleora were confirm'd his prize<br />
That has the strongest arm and sharpest sword,<br />
I'd court Bellona in her horrid trim,<br />
As if she were a mistress; and bless fortune,<br />
That offers my young valour to the proof,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>How much I dare do for your sister's love.<br />
But, when that I consider how averse<br />
Your noble father, great Archidamus,<br />
Is, and hath ever been, to my desires,<br />
Reason may warrant me to doubt and fear,<br />
What seeds soever I sow in these wars<br />
Of noble courage, his determinate will<br />
May blast, and give my harvest to another,<br />
That never toil'd for it.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Prithee, do not nourish<br />
These jealous thoughts; I am thine, (and pardon me,<br />
Though I repeat it,) thy Timagoras,<br />
That, for thy sake, when the bold Theban sued,<br />
Far-famed Pisander, for my sister's love,<br />
Sent him disgraced and discontented home.<br />
I wrought my father then; and I, that stopp'd not<br />
In the career of my affection to thee,<br />
When that renowned worthy, that brought with him<br />
High birth, wealth, courage, as feed advocates<br />
To mediate for him; never will consent<br />
A fool, that only has the shape of man,<br />
Asotus, though he be rich Cleon's heir,<br />
Shall bear her from thee.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> In that trust I love.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Which never shall deceive you.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Sir, the general,<br />
Timoleon, by his trumpets hath given warning<br />
For a remove.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> 'Tis well; provide my horse.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I shall, sir.
<span style="margin-left:8em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
<i>Leost.</i> This slave has a strange aspect.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Fit for his fortune; 'tis a strong-limb'd knave:<br />
My father bought him for my sister's litter.<br />
O pride of women! Coaches are too common&mdash;<br />
They surfeit in the happiness of peace,<br />
And ladies think they keep not state enough,<br />
If, for their pomp and ease<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, they are not borne<br />
In triumph on men's shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Who commands<br />
The Carthaginian fleet?</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Gisco's their admiral,<br />
And 'tis our happiness; a raw young fellow,<br />
One never train'd in arms, but rather fashion'd<br />
To tilt with ladies' lips, than crack a lance;<br />
Ravish a feather from a mistress' fan<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>,<br />
And wear it as a favour. A steel helmet,<br />
Made horrid with a glorious plume, will crack<br />
His woman's neck.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> No more of him.&mdash;The motives,<br />
That Corinth gives us aid?</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> The common danger;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>For Sicily being afire, she is not safe:<br />
It being apparent that ambitious Carthage,<br />
That, to enlarge her empire, strives to fasten<br />
An unjust gripe on us that live free lords<br />
Of Syracusa, will not end, till Greece<br />
Acknowledge her their sovereign.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> I am satisfied.<br />
What think you of our general?</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> He's a man
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Trumpets within.</i></span><br />
Of strange and reserved parts; but a great soldier.<br />
His trumpets call us, I'll forbear his character:<br />
To-morrow, in the senate-house, at large<br />
He will express himself.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> I'll follow you.

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Syracuse. The Senate-house.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Archidamus, Cleon, Diphilus, Olympia,
Corisca, Cleora</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Zanthia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> So careless we have been, my noble lords,<br />
In the disposing of our own affairs,<br />
And ignorant in the art of government,<br />
That now we need a stranger to instruct us.<br />
Yet we are happy that our neighbour Corinth,<br />
Pitying the unjust gripe Carthage would lay<br />
On Syracusa, hath vouchsafed to lend us<br />
Her man of men, Timoleon, to defend<br />
Our country and our liberties.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> 'Tis a favour<br />
We are unworthy of, and we may blush<br />
Necessity compels us to receive it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<i>Archid.</i> O shame! that we, that are a populous nation,<br />
Engaged to liberal nature for all blessings<br />
An island can bring forth; we, that have limbs,<br />
And able bodies; shipping, arms, and treasure,<br />
The sinews of the war, now we are call'd<br />
To stand upon our guard, cannot produce<br />
One fit to be our general.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> I am old and fat;<br />
I could say something, else.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> We must obey<br />
The time and our occasions; ruinous buildings,<br />
Whose bases and foundations are infirm,<br />
Must use supporters: we are circled round<br />
With danger; o'er our heads, with sail-stretch'd wings,<br />
Destruction hovers, and a cloud of mischief<br />
Ready to break upon us; no hope left us<br />
That may divert it, but our sleeping virtue,<br />
Roused up by brave Timoleon.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> When arrives he?</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> He is expected every hour.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> The braveries<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a><br />
Of Syracusa, among whom my son,<br />
Timagoras, Leosthenes, and Asotus,<br />
Your hopeful heir, lord Cleon, two days since<br />
Rode forth to meet him, and attend him to<br />
The city; every minute we expect<br />
To be bless'd with his presence.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">[<i>Shouts within; then a flourish of trumpets.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> What shout's this?</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> 'Tis seconded with loud music.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Which confirms<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
His wish'd-for entrance. Let us entertain him<br />
With all respect, solemnity, and pomp,<br />
A man may merit, that comes to redeem us<br />
From slavery and oppression.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> I'll lock up<br />
My doors, and guard my gold: these lads of Corinth<br />
Have nimble fingers, and I fear them more,<br />
Being within our walls, than those of Carthage;<br />
They are far off.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> And, ladies, be it your care<br />
To welcome him and his followers with all duty:<br />
For rest resolved, their hands and swords must keep you<br />
In that full height of happiness you live;<br />
A dreadful change else follows.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Archidamus, Cleon</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Diphilus</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Olymp.</i> We are instructed.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> Musing, Cleora?</p>

<p><i>Olymp.</i> She's studying how to entertain these strangers,<br />
And to engross them to herself.</p>

<p><i>Cleor.</i> No, surely.</p>

<p><i>Olymp.</i> No more; they come.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Flourish of trumpets. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Timagoras, Leosthenes,

by</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo, Gracculo, Cimbrio</span>, <i>and other

<p><i>Archid.</i> It is your seat: which, with a general suffrage,      [<i>Offering</i> <span class="smcap">Timoleon</span> <i>the state</i><a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
As to the supreme magistrate, Sicily tenders,<br />
And prays Timoleon to accept.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Such honours<br />
To one ambitious of rule<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> or titles,<br />
Whose heaven on earth is placed in his command,<br />
And absolute power o'er others, would with joy,<br />
And veins swollen high with pride, be entertain'd.<br />
They take not me; for I have ever loved<br />
An equal freedom, and proclaim'd all such<br />
As would usurp on others' liberties<br />
Rebels to nature, to whose bounteous blessings<br />
All men lay claim as true legitimate sons:<br />
But such as have made forfeit of themselves<br />
By vicious courses, and their birthright lost,<br />
'Tis not injustice they are mark'd for slaves,<br />
To serve the virtuous. For myself, I know<br />
Honours and great employments are great burdens,<br />
And must require an Atlas to support them.<br />
He that would govern others, first should be<br />
The master of himself, richly endued<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>With depth of understanding, height of courage,<br />
And those remarkable graces which I dare not<br />
Ascribe unto myself.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Sir, empty men<br />
Are trumpets of their own deserts; but you,<br />
That are not in opinion, but in proof,<br />
Really good, and full of glorious parts,<br />
Leave the report of what you are to fame,<br />
Which, from the ready tongues of all good men,<br />
Aloud proclaims you.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> Besides, you stand bound,<br />
Having so large a field to exercise<br />
Your active virtues offer'd you, to impart<br />
Your strength to such as need it.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> 'Tis confess'd;<br />
And, since you'll have it so, such as I am,<br />
For you, and for the liberty of Greece,<br />
I am most ready to lay down my life:<br />
But yet consider, men of Syracusa,<br />
Before that you deliver up the power,<br />
Which yet is yours, to me,&mdash;to whom 'tis given;<br />
To an impartial man, with whom nor threats<br />
Nor prayers shall prevail; for I must steer<br />
An even course.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Which is desired of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
<i>Timol.</i> Timophanes, my brother<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, for whose death<br />
I am tainted in the world, and foully tainted;<br />
In whose remembrance I have ever worn,<br />
In peace and war, this livery of sorrow;<br />
Can witness for me how much I detest<br />
Tyrannous usurpation. With grief<br />
I must remember it; for when no persuasion<br />
Could win him to desist from his bad practice,<br />
To change the aristocracy of Corinth<br />
Into an absolute monarchy, I chose rather<br />
To prove a pious and obedient son<br />
To my country, my best mother<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, than to lend<br />
Assistance to Timophanes, though my brother,<br />
That, like a tyrant, strove to set his foot<br />
Upon the city's freedom.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> 'Twas a deed<br />
Deserving rather trophies than reproof.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> And will be still remember'd to your honour,<br />
If you forsake not us.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> If you free Sicily<br />
From barbarous Carthage' yoke<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>, it will be said<br />
In him you slew a tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
<i>Archid.</i> But, giving way<br />
To her invasion, not vouchsafing us<br />
That fly to your protection aid and comfort,<br />
'Twill be believed that, for your private ends,<br />
You kill'd a brother.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> As I then proceed,<br />
To all posterity may that act be crown'd<br />
With a deserved applause, or branded with<br />
The mark of infamy.&mdash;Stay yet: ere I take<br />
This seat of justice, or engage myself<br />
To fight for you abroad, or to reform<br />
Your state at home, swear all upon my sword,<br />
And call the gods of Sicily to witness<br />
The oath you take, that whatsoe'er I shall<br />
Propound for safety of your commonwealth,<br />
Not circumscribed or bound in, shall by you<br />
Be willingly obey'd.</p>

<p><i>Archid. Diph. Cleon.</i> So may we prosper,<br />
As we obey in all things!</p>

<p><i>Timag. Leost. Asot.</i> And observe<br />
All your commands as oracles!</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Do not repent it.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Takes the state.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Olymp.</i> He ask'd not our consent.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> He's a clown, I warrant him.</p>

<p><i>Olymp.</i> He thinks women<br />
No part of the republic.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> He shall find<br />
We are a commonwealth.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> The less your honour.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> First, then, a word or two, but without bitterness,<br />
(And yet mistake me not, I am no flatterer,)<br />
Concerning your ill government of the state;<br />
In which the greatest, noblest, and most rich,<br />
Stand, in the first file, guilty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<i>Cleon.</i> Ha! how's this?</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> You have not, as good patriots should do, studied<br />
The public good, but your particular ends;<br />
Factious among yourselves, preferring such<br />
To offices and honours, as ne'er read<br />
The elements of saving policy,<br />
But deeply skill'd in all the principles<br />
That usher to destruction.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Sharp!</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> The better.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Your senate-house, which used not to admit<br />
A man, however popular, to stand<br />
At the helm of government, whose youth was not<br />
Made glorious by action; whose experience,<br />
Crown'd with gray hairs, gave warrant to his counsels,<br />
Heard and received with reverence; is now fill'd<br />
With green heads, that determine of the state<br />
Over their cups, or when their sated lusts<br />
Afford them leisure; or supplied by those<br />
Who, rising from base arts and sordid thrift,<br />
Are eminent for their wealth, not for their wisdom:<br />
Which is the reason that to hold a place<br />
In council, which was once esteem'd an honour,<br />
And a reward for virtue, hath quite lost<br />
Lustre and reputation, and is made<br />
A mercenary purchase.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> He speaks home.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> And to the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> From whence it proceeds,<br />
That the treasure of the city is engross'd<br />
By a few private men, the public coffers<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>Hollow with want; and they, that will not spare<br />
One talent for the common good, to feed<br />
The pride and bravery of their wives, consume,<br />
In plate, in jewels, and superfluous slaves,<br />
What would maintain an army.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> Have at us!</p>

<p><i>Olymp.</i> We thought we were forgot.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> But it appears<br />
You will be treated of.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Yet, in this plenty,<br />
And fat of peace, your young men ne'er were train'd<br />
In martial discipline; and your ships unrigg'd<br />
Rot in the harbour: no defence prepared,<br />
But thought unuseful; as if that the gods,<br />
Indulgent to your sloth, had granted you<br />
A perpetuity of pride and pleasure,<br />
No change fear'd or expected. Now you find<br />
That Carthage, looking on your stupid sleeps<br />
And dull security, was invited to<br />
Invade your territories.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> You have made us see, sir,<br />
To our shame, the country's sickness: now from you,<br />
As from a careful and a wise physician,<br />
We do expect the cure.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Old fester'd sores<br />
Must be lanced to the quick, and cauterized;<br />
Which borne with patience, after I'll apply<br />
Soft unguents. For the maintenance of the war,<br />
It is decreed all moneys in the hand<br />
Of private men shall instantly be brought<br />
To the public treasury.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> This bites sore.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> The cure<br />
Is worse than the disease; I'll never yield to 't:<br />
What could the enemy, though victorious,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>Inflict more on us? All that my youth hath toil'd for,<br />
Purchased with industry, and preserved with care,<br />
Forced from me in a moment!</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> This rough course<br />
Will never be allow'd of.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> O blind men!<br />
If you refuse the first means that is offer'd<br />
To give you health, no hope's left to recover<br />
Your desperate sickness. Do you prize your muck<br />
Above your liberties? and rather choose<br />
To be made bondmen, than to part with that<br />
To which already you are slaves? Or can it<br />
Be probable, in your flattering apprehensions,<br />
You can capitulate with the conquerors,<br />
And keep that yours which they come to possess,<br />
And, while you kneel in vain, will ravish from you?<br />
&mdash;But take your own ways; brood upon your gold.<br />
Sacrifice to your idol, and preserve<br />
The prey entire, and merit the report<br />
Of careful stewards: yield a just account<br />
To your proud masters, who, with whips of iron,<br />
Will force you to give up what you conceal,<br />
Or tear it from your throats: adorn your walls<br />
With Persian hangings wrought of gold and pearl;<br />
Cover the floors on which they are to tread<br />
With costly Median silks; perfume the rooms<br />
With cassia and amber, where they are<br />
To feast and revel; while, like servile grooms,<br />
You wait upon their trenchers: feed their eyes<br />
With massy plate, until your cupboards crack<br />
With the weight that they sustain; and, to perfect<br />
Their entertainment, offer up your sons<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>And able men for slaves; while you, that are<br />
Unfit for labour, are spurn'd out to starve,<br />
Unpitied, in some desert, no friend by,<br />
Whose sorrow may spare one compassionate tear<br />
In the remembrance of what once you were.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> The blood turns.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Observe how old Cleon shakes,<br />
As if in picture he had shown him what<br />
He was to suffer.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> I am sick: the man<br />
Speaks poniards and diseases.</p>

<p><i>Olymp.</i> O my doctor!<br />
I never shall recover.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> [<i>coming forward.</i>] If a virgin,<br />
Whose speech was ever yet usher'd with fear,<br />
One knowing modesty and humble silence<br />
To be the choicest ornaments of our sex,<br />
In the presence of so many reverend men<br />
Struck dumb with terror and astonishment,<br />
Presume to clothe her thought in vocal sounds,<br />
Let her find pardon. First to you, great sir,<br />
A bashful maid's thanks, and her zealous prayers<br />
Wing'd with pure innocence, bearing them to heaven,<br />
For all prosperity that the gods can give<br />
To one whose piety must exact their care,<br />
Thus low I offer.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> 'Tis a happy omen.<br />
Rise, blest one, and speak boldly. On my virtue,<br />
I am thy warrant from so clear a spring<br />
Sweet rivers ever flow.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Then, thus to you,<br />
My noble father, and these lords, to whom<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>I next owe duty: no respect forgotten<br />
To you, my brother, and these bold young men,<br />
(Such I would have them,) that are, or should he,<br />
The city's sword and target of defence.<br />
To all of you I speak; and, if a blush<br />
Steal on my cheeks, it is shown to reprove<br />
Your paleness, willingly I would not say,<br />
Your cowardice or fear: Think you all treasure<br />
Hid in the bowels of the earth, or shipwreck'd<br />
In Neptune's wat'ry kingdom, can hold weight,<br />
When liberty and honour fill one scale,<br />
Triumphant Justice sitting on the beam?<br />
Or dare you but imagine that your gold is<br />
Too dear a salary for such as hazard<br />
Their blood and lives in your defence? For me,<br />
An ignorant girl, bear witness, heaven! so far<br />
I prize a soldier, that, to give him pay,<br />
With such devotion as our flamens offer<br />
Their sacrifices at the holy altar,<br />
I do lay down these jewels, will make sale<br />
Of my superfluous wardrobe, to supply<br />
The meanest of their wants.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">[<i>Lays down her jewels, &amp;c.; the rest follow her example.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Brave masculine spirit!</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> We are shown, to our shame, what we in honour<br />
Should have taught others.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Such a fair example<br />
Must needs be follow'd.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Ever my dear sister,<br />
But now our family's glory!</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Were she deform'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>The virtues of her mind would force a stoic<br />
To sue to be her servant.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> I must yield;<br />
And, though my heart-blood part with it, I will<br />
Deliver in my wealth.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> I would say something;<br />
But, the truth is, I know not what.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> We have money;<br />
And men must now be thought on.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> We can press<br />
Of labourers in the country, men inured<br />
To cold and heat, ten thousand.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> Or, if need be,<br />
Enrol our slaves, lusty and able varlets,<br />
And fit for service.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> They shall go for me;<br />
I will not pay and fight too.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> How! your slaves?<br />
O stain of honour!&mdash;&mdash;Once more, sir, your pardon;<br />
And, to their shames, let me deliver what<br />
I know in justice you may speak.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Most gladly:<br />
I could not wish my thoughts a better organ<br />
Than your tongue, to express them.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Are you men!<br />
(For age may qualify, though not excuse,<br />
The backwardness of these,) able young men!<br />
Yet, now your country's liberty's at the stake,<br />
Honour and glorious triumph made the garland<br />
For such as dare deserve them; a rich feast<br />
Prepared by Victory, of immortal viands,<br />
Not for base men, but such as with their swords<br />
Dare force admittance, and will be her guests:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>And can you coldly suffer such rewards<br />
To be proposed to labourers and slaves?<br />
While you, that are born noble, to whom these,<br />
Valued at their best rate, are next to horses,<br />
Or other beasts of carriage, cry aim<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>!<br />
Like idle lookers on, till their proud worth<br />
Make them become your masters!</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> By my hopes,<br />
There's fire and spirit enough in this to make<br />
Thersites valiant.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> No; far, far be it from you:<br />
Let these of meaner quality contend<br />
Who can endure most labour; plough the earth,<br />
And think they are rewarded when their toil<br />
Brings home a fruitful harvest to their lords;<br />
Let them prove good artificers, and serve you<br />
For use and ornament, but not presume<br />
To touch at what is noble. If you think them<br />
Unworthy to taste of those cates you feed on,<br />
Or wear such costly garments, will you grant them<br />
The privilege and prerogative of great minds,<br />
Which you were born to? Honour won in war,<br />
And to be styled preservers of their country,<br />
Are titles fit for free and generous spirits,<br />
And not for bondmen. Had I been born a man,<br />
And such ne'er-dying glories made the prize<br />
To bold heroic courage, by Diana,<br />
I would not to my brother, nay, my father,<br />
Be bribed to part with the least piece of honour<br />
I should gain in this action!</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> She's inspired,<br />
Or in her speaks the genius of your country,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>To fire your blood in her defence: I am rapt<br />
With the imagination. Noble maid,<br />
Timoleon is your soldier, and will sweat<br />
Drops of his best blood, but he will bring home<br />
Triumphant conquest to you. Let me wear<br />
Your colours, lady; and though youthful heats,<br />
That look no further than your outward form,<br />
Are long since buried in me; while I live,<br />
I am a constant lover of your mind,<br />
That does transcend all precedents.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> 'Tis an honour,
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Gives her scarf.</i></span><br />
And so I do receive it.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> I am for the journey.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> May all diseases sloth and luxury bring<br />
Fall upon him that stays at home!</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Though old,<br />
I will be there in person.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> So will I:<br />
Methinks I am not what I was; her words<br />
Have made me younger, by a score of years,<br />
Than I was when I came hither.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> I shall never<br />
Make a good soldier, and therefore desire<br />
To be excused at home.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> 'Tis my suit too.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Have your desires; you would be burthens to us.&mdash;<br />
Lead, fairest, to the temple; first we'll pay<br />
A sacrifice to the gods for good success:<br />
For all great actions the wish'd course do run,<br />
That are, with their allowance, well begun.<br />

If you dare second me.</p>

<h3>ACT II. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Archidamus</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Archidamus, Timagoras, Leosthenes</span>,
<i>with gorgets; and</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> So, so, 'tis well: how do I look?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Most sprightfully.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> I shrink not in the shoulders; though I'm old<br />
I'm tough, steel to the back; I have not wasted<br />
My stock of strength in featherbeds: here's an arm too;<br />
There's stuff in 't, and I hope will use a sword<br />
As well as any beardless boy of you all.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> I'm glad to see you, sir, so well prepared<br />
To endure the travail of the war.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Go to, sirrah!<br />
I shall endure, when some of you keep your cabins,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>For all your flaunting feathers; nay, Leosthenes,<br />
You are welcome too<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, all friends and fellows now.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Your servant, sir.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Pish! leave these compliments,<br />
They stink in a soldier's mouth; I could be merry,<br />
For, now my gown's off, farewell gravity<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>!<br />
I fear ye, when you come to the test.&mdash;Old stories tell us,<br />
There's a month call'd October<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>, which brings in<br />
Cold weather; there are trenches too, 'tis rumour'd,<br />
In which to stand all night to the knees in water,<br />
In gallants breeds the toothach; there's a sport too,<br />
Named <i>lying perdue</i>, do you mark me? 'tis a game<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>Which you must learn to play at: now in these seasons,<br />
And choice variety of exercises,<br />
(Nay, I come to you,) and fasts, not for devotion,<br />
Your rambling youngster feels strange alterations;<br />
And in a frosty morning.&mdash;&mdash;O welcome! welcome!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Diphilus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Cleora</span>.</p>

<p>You have cut off my discourse; but I will perfect<br />
My lecture in the camp.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> Come, we are stay'd for;<br />
The general's afire for a remove,<br />
And longs to be in action.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> 'Tis my wish too.<br />
We must part&mdash;nay, no tears, my best Cleora;<br />
I shall melt too, and that were ominous.<br />
Millions of blessings on thee! All that's mine<br />
I give up to thy charge; and, sirrah, look<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span>.</span><br />
You with that care and reverence observe her,<br />
Which you would pay to me.&mdash;A kiss; farewell, girl!</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> Peace wait upon you, fair one!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Archidamus, Diphilus</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> 'Twere impertinence<br />
To wish you to be careful of your honour,<br />
That ever keep in pay a guard about you<br />
Of faithful virtues: farewell!&mdash;Friend, I leave you<br />
To wipe our kisses off; I know that lovers<br />
Part with more circumstance and ceremony:<br />
Which I give way to.
<span style="margin-left:9em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> 'Tis a noble favour,<br />
For which I ever owe you. We are alone;<br />
But how I should begin, or in what language<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>Speak the unwilling word of parting from you,<br />
I am yet to learn.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> And still continue ignorant;<br />
For I must be most cruel to myself,<br />
If I should teach you.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Yet it must be spoken,<br />
Or you will chide my slackness. You have fired me<br />
With the heat of noble action to deserve you;<br />
And the least spark of honour that took life<br />
From your sweet breath, still fann'd by it and cherish'd,<br />
Must mount up in a glorious flame, or I<br />
Am much unworthy.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> May it not burn here<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>,<br />
And, as a seamark, serve to guide true lovers<br />
Safe from the rocks of passion to the harbour<br />
Of pure affection? rising up an example<br />
Which aftertimes shall witness, to our glory,<br />
First took from us beginning.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> 'Tis a happiness<br />
My duty to my country, and mine honour<br />
Cannot consent to; besides, add to these,<br />
It was your pleasure, fortified by persuasion,<br />
And strength of reason, for the general good,<br />
That I should go.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Alas! I then was witty<br />
To plead against myself; and mine eye, fix'd<br />
Upon the hill of honour, ne'er descended<br />
To look into the vale of certain dangers,<br />
Through which you were to cut your passage to it.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> I'll stay at home, then.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> No, that must not be;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>For so, to serve my own ends, and to gain<br />
A petty wreath myself, I rob you of<br />
A certain triumph, which must fall upon you,<br />
Or Virtue's turn'd a handmaid to blind Fortune.<br />
How is my soul divided! to confirm you<br />
In the opinion of the world, most worthy<br />
To be beloved, (with me you're at the height,<br />
And can advance no further,) I must send you<br />
To court the goddess of stern war, who, if<br />
She see you with my eyes, will ne'er return you,<br />
But grow enamour'd of you.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Sweet, take comfort!<br />
And what I offer you, you must vouchsafe me,<br />
Or I am wretched. All the dangers that<br />
I can encounter in the war are trifles;<br />
My enemies abroad to be contemn'd:<br />
The dreadful foes, that have the power to hurt me,<br />
I leave at home with you.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> With me!</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Nay, in you,<br />
In every part about you, they are arm'd<br />
To fight against me.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Where?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> There's no perfection<br />
That you are mistress of, but musters up<br />
A legion against me, and all sworn<br />
To my destruction.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> This is strange!</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> But true, sweet;<br />
Excess of love can work such miracles!<br />
Upon this ivory forehead are intrench'd<br />
Ten thousand rivals, and these suns command<br />
Supplies from all the world, on pain to forfeit<br />
Their comfortable beams; these ruby lips,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>A rich exchequer to assure their pay:<br />
This hand, Sibylla's golden bough to guard them<br />
Through hell, and horror, to the Elysian springs;<br />
Which who'll not venture for? and, should I name<br />
Such as the virtues of your mind invite,<br />
Their numbers would be infinite.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Can you think<br />
I may be tempted?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> You were never proved<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.<br />
For me, I have conversed with you no further<br />
Than would become a brother. I ne'er tuned<br />
Loose notes to your chaste ears; or brought rich presents<br />
For my artillery, to batter down<br />
The fortress of your honour; I never practised<br />
The cunning and corrupting arts they study,<br />
That wander in the wild maze of desire;<br />
Honest simplicity and truth were all<br />
The agents I employ'd; and when I came<br />
To see you, it was with that reverence<br />
As I beheld the altars of the gods:<br />
And Love, that came along with me, was taught<br />
To leave his arrows and his torch behind,<br />
Quench'd in my fear to give offence.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> And 'twas<br />
That modesty that took me, and preserves me,<br />
Like a fresh rose, in mine own natural sweetness;<br />
Which, sullied with the touch of impure hands,<br />
Loses both scent and beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
<i>Leost.</i> But, Cleora,<br />
When I am absent, as I must go from you,<br />
(Such is the cruelty of my fate,) and leave you,<br />
Unguarded, to the violent assaults<br />
Of loose temptations; when the memory<br />
Of my so many years of love and service<br />
Is lost in other objects; when you are courted<br />
By such as keep a catalogue of their conquests,<br />
Won upon credulous virgins; when nor father<br />
Is here to owe<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> you, brother to advise you,<br />
Nor your poor servant by, to keep such off,<br />
By love instructed how to undermine,<br />
And blow your constancy up; when your weak senses,<br />
At once assaulted, shall conspire against you,<br />
And play the traitors to your soul, your virtue;<br />
How can you stand? 'Faith, though you fall, and I<br />
The judge, before whom you then stood accused,<br />
I should acquit you.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Will you then confirm<br />
That love and jealousy, though of different natures,<br />
Must of necessity be twins; the younger<br />
Created only to defeat the elder,<br />
And spoil him of his birthright<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>? 'tis not well.<br />
But being to part, I will not chide, I will not;<br />
Nor with one syllable or tear, express<br />
How deeply I am wounded with the arrows<br />
Of your distrust: but when that you shall hear,<br />
At your return, how I have borne myself,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>And what an austere penance I take on me,<br />
To satisfy your doubts; when, like a vestal,<br />
I show you, to your shame, the fire still burning,<br />
Committed to my charge by true affection,<br />
The people joining with you in the wonder;<br />
When, by the glorious splendour of my sufferings,<br />
The prying eyes of jealousy are struck blind,<br />
The monster too that feeds on fears e'en starved<br />
For want of seeming matter to accuse me;<br />
Expect, Leosthenes, a sharp reproof<br />
From my just anger.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> What will you do?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Obey me,<br />
Or from this minute you are a stranger to me;<br />
And do 't without reply. All-seeing sun,<br />
Thou witness of my innocence, thus I close<br />
Mine eyes against thy comfortable light,<br />
'Till the return of this distrustful man!<br />
Now bind them sure;&mdash;nay, do 't: [<i>He binds her eyes with her scarf.</i>] If, uncompell'd,<br />
I loose this knot, until the hands that made it<br />
Be pleased to untie it, may consuming plagues<br />
Fall heavy on me! pray you guide me to your lips.<br />
This kiss, when you come back, shall be a virgin<br />
To bid you welcome; nay, I have not done yet:<br />
I will continue dumb, and, you once gone,<br />
No accent shall come from me. Now to my chamber,<br />
My tomb, if you miscarry: there I'll spend<br />
My hours in silent mourning, and thus much<br />
Shall be reported of me to my glory,<br />
And you confess it, whether I live or die,<br />
My constancy triumphs o'er your jealousy.<br />

<p><i>Asot.</i> You slave! you dog! down, cur!</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Hold, good young master,<br />
For pity's sake!</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> Now am I in my kingdom:&mdash;<br />
Who says I am not valiant? I begin<br />
To frown again: quake, villain!</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> So I do, sir;<br />
Your looks are agues to me.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> Are they so, sir!<br />
'Slight, if I had them at this bay that flout me,<br />
And say I look like a sheep and an ass, I'd make them<br />
Feel that I am a lion.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Do not roar, sir,<br />
As you are a valiant beast: but do you know<br />
Why you use me thus?</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> I'll beat thee a little more,<br />
Then study for a reason. O! I have it:<br />
One brake a jest on me, and then I swore,<br />
(Because I durst not strike him,) when I came home,<br />
That I would break thy head.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Plague on his mirth!<br />
I am sure I mourn for 't.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> Remember too, I charge you,<br />
To teach my horse good manners yet; this morning,<br />
As I rode to take the air, the untutor'd jade<br />
Threw me, and kick'd me.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> I thank him for 't.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> What's that?</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> I say, sir, I will teach him to hold his heels,<br />
If you will rule your fingers.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> I'll think upon 't.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> I am bruised to jelly: better be a dog,<br />
Than slave to a fool or coward.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> Here's my mother,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Corisca</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Zanthia</span>.</p>

<p>She is chastising too: how brave we live,<br />
That have our slaves to beat, to keep us in breath<br />
When we want exercise!</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> Careless creature,
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Striking her.</i></span><br />
Look to 't; if a curl fall, or wind or sun<br />
Take my complexion off, I will not leave<br />
One hair upon thine head.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Here's a second show<br />
Of the family of pride!
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> Fie on these wars!<br />
I'm starved for want of action. When were you with<br />
Your mistress, fair Cleora?</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> Two days sithence;<br />
But she's so coy, forsooth, that ere I can<br />
Speak a penn'd speech I have bought and studied for her,<br />
Her woman calls her away.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Poliphron</span>. <i>A Table set out
with Wine, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> 'Twill take, I warrant thee.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> You may do your pleasure;<br />
But, in my judgment, better to make use of<br />
The present opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> No more.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> I am silenced.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> More wine; prithee drink hard, friend,<br />
And when we're hot, whatever I propound,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cimbrio, Gracculo</span>, <i>and other Slaves.</i></p>

<p>Second with vehemence.&mdash;Men of your words, all welcome!<br />
Slaves use no ceremony; sit down; here's a health.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> Let it run round; fill every man his glass.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> We look for no waiters;&mdash;this is wine!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> The better,<br />
Strong, lusty wine: drink deep; this juice will make us<br />
As free as our lords.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Drinks.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> But if they find we taste it,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>We are condemn'd to the quarry during life,<br />
Without hope of redemption.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Pish! for that<br />
We'll talk anon: another rouse<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>! we lose time;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">[<i>Drinks.</i></span><br />
When our low blood's wound up a little higher,<br />
I'll offer my design; nay, we are cold yet;<br />
These glasses contain nothing:&mdash;do me right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">[<i>Takes the bottle.</i></span><br />
As e'er you hope for liberty. 'Tis done bravely:<br />
How do you feel yourselves now?</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> I begin<br />
To have strange conundrums in my head.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> And I<br />
To loathe base water. I would be hang'd in peace now<br />
For one month of such holidays.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> An age, boys,<br />
And yet defy the whip; if you are men,<br />
Or dare believe you have souls.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> We are no brokers.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Our lords are no gods&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> They are devils to us, I am sure.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> But subject to<br />
Cold, hunger, and diseases.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> In abundance.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Equal Nature fashion'd us<br />
All in one mould. The bear serves not the bear,<br />
Nor the wolf the wolf; 'twas odds of strength in tyrants<br />
That pluck'd the first link from the golden chain<br />
With which that <span class="smcap">Thing of Things</span><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> bound in the world.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>Why then, since we are taught, by their examples,<br />
To love our liberty, if not command,<br />
Should the strong serve the weak, the fair, deform'd ones?<br />
Or such as know the cause of things pay tribute<br />
To ignorant fools? All's but the outward gloss,<br />
And politic form, that does distinguish us.&mdash;<br />
Cimbrio, thou art a strong man; if, in place<br />
Of carrying burthens, thou hadst been train'd up<br />
In martial discipline, thou might'st have proved<br />
A general, fit to lead and fight for Sicily,<br />
As fortunate as Timoleon.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> A little fighting<br />
Will serve a general's turn.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Thou, Gracculo,<br />
Hast fluency of language, quick conceit;<br />
And, I think, cover'd with a senator's robe,<br />
Formally set on the bench, thou wouldst appear<br />
As brave a senator.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Would I had lands,<br />
Or money to buy a place! and if I did not<br />
Sleep on the bench with the drowsiest of them,<br />
Play with my chain, look on my watch, and wear<br />
A state beard, with my barber's help, rank with them<br />
In their most choice peculiar gifts, degrade me,<br />
And put me to drink water again, which, now<br />
I have tasted wine, were poison!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> 'Tis spoke nobly,<br />
And like a gownman: none of these, I think too,<br />
But would prove good burghers.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Hum! the fools are modest;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>I know their insides: here's an ill-faced fellow,<br />
(But that will not be seen in a dark shop;)<br />
If he did not in a month learn to outswear,<br />
In the selling of his wares, the cunning'st tradesman<br />
In Syracuse, I have no skill. Here's another;<br />
Observe but what a cozening look he has!&mdash;<br />
Hold up thy head, man! If, for drawing gallants<br />
Into mortgages for commodities<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, cheating heirs<br />
With your new counterfeit gold thread, and gumm'd velvets,<br />
He does not transcend all that went before him,<br />
Call in his patent.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Is 't not pity, then,<br />
Men of such eminent virtues should be slaves?</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Our fortune.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> 'Tis your folly: daring men<br />
Command and make their fates. Say, at this instant,<br />
I mark'd you out a way to liberty;<br />
Possess'd you of those blessings our proud lords<br />
So long have surfeited in; and, what is sweetest,<br />
Arm you with power, by strong hand to revenge<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>Your stripes, your unregarded toil, the pride,<br />
The insolence, of such as tread upon<br />
Your patient sufferings; fill your famish'd mouths<br />
With the fat and plenty of the land; redeem you<br />
From the dark vale of servitude, and seat you<br />
Upon a hill of happiness; what would you do<br />
To purchase this, and more?</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Do! any thing:<br />
To burn a church or two, and dance by the light on 't,<br />
Were but a May-game.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> I have a father living;<br />
But if the cutting of his throat could work this,<br />
He should excuse me.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> 'Slight! I would cut mine own,<br />
Rather than miss it; so I might but have<br />
A taste on 't ere I die.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Be resolute men;<br />
You shall run no such hazard, nor groan under<br />
The burden of such crying sins.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> Do not torment us<br />
With expectation.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Thus, then:&mdash;Our proud masters,<br />
And all the able freemen of the city,<br />
Are gone unto the wars&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> Observe but that.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Old men, and such as can make no resistance,<br />
Are only left at home&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> And the proud young fool,<br />
My master&mdash;if this take, I'll hamper him.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Their arsenal, their treasure, 's in our power,<br />
If we have hearts to seize them. If our lords fall<br />
In the present action, the whole country's ours:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>Say they return victorious, we have means<br />
To keep the town against them; at the worst,<br />
To make our own conditions. If you dare break up<br />
Their iron chests, banquet in their rich halls,<br />
And carve yourselves of all delights and pleasures<br />
You have been barr'd from, with one voice cry with me,<br />
Liberty! liberty!</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Liberty! liberty!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Go, then, and take possession: use all freedom;<br />
But shed no blood. [<i>Exeunt Slaves.</i>]&mdash;So, this is well begun;<br />
But not to be commended till 't be done.

<h3>ACT III. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Gallery in</i> <span class="smcap">Archidamus</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timandra</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Why, think you that I plot against myself<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>?<br />
Fear nothing, you are safe: these thick-skinn'd slaves,<br />
I use as instruments to serve my ends,<br />
Pierce not my deep designs; nor shall they dare<br />
To lift an arm against you.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> With your will.<br />
But turbulent spirits, raised beyond themselves<br />
With ease, are not so soon laid; they oft prove<br />
Dangerous to him that call'd them up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
<i>Mar.</i> 'Tis true,<br />
In what is rashly undertook. Long since<br />
I have consider'd seriously their natures,<br />
Proceeded with mature advice, and know<br />
I hold their will and faculties in more awe<br />
Than I can do my own. Now, for their licence,<br />
And riot in the city, I can make<br />
A just defence and use: it may appear, too,<br />
A politic prevention of such ills<br />
As might, with greater violence and danger,<br />
Hereafter be attempted; though some smart for 't,<br />
It matters not:&mdash;however, I'm resolved;<br />
And sleep you with security. Holds Cleora<br />
Constant to her rash vow?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Beyond belief;<br />
To me, that see her hourly, it seems a fable.<br />
By signs I guess at her commands, and serve them<br />
With silence; such her pleasure is, made known<br />
By holding her fair hand thus. She eats little,<br />
Sleeps less, as I imagine; once a day<br />
I lead her to this gallery, where she walks<br />
Some half a dozen turns, and, having offer'd<br />
To her absent saint a sacrifice of sighs,<br />
She points back to her prison.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Guide her hither,<br />
And make her understand the slaves' revolt;<br />
And, with your utmost eloquence, enlarge<br />
Their insolence, and wrongs done in the city.<br />
Forget not, too, I am their chief, and tell her<br />
You strongly think my extreme dotage on her,<br />
As I'm Marullo, caused this sudden uproar,<br />
To gain possession of her.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Punctually<br />
I will discharge my part.

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Poliphron</span>.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> O, sir, I sought you:<br />
There's such variety of all disorders<br />
Among the slaves; answer'd with crying, howling,<br />
By the citizens and their wives; such a confusion,<br />
In a word, not to tire you, as I think<br />
The like was never read of.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> This is some<br />
Revenge for my disgrace.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> But, sir, I fear,<br />
If your authority restrain them not,<br />
They'll fire the city, or kill one another,<br />
They are so apt to outrage; neither know I<br />
Whether you wish it, and came therefore to<br />
Acquaint you with so much.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I will among them;<br />
But must not long be absent.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> At your pleasure.

<p class="center"><i>Shouts within. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cleora</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timandra</span>.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> They are at our gates: my heart! affrights and horrors<br />
Increase each minute. No way left to save us,<br />
No flattering hope to comfort us, or means,<br />
But miracle, to redeem us from base wrongs<br />
And lawless rapine! Are there gods, yet suffer<br />
Such innocent sweetness to be made the spoil<br />
Of brutish violence? And, of these rebel slaves,<br />
He that should offer up his life to guard you,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>Marullo, cursed Marullo, your own bondman,<br />
Purchased to serve you, and fed by your favours&mdash;<br />
Nay, start not: it is he; he, the grand captain<br />
Of these libidinous beasts, that have not left<br />
One cruel act undone that barbarous conquest<br />
Yet ever practised in a captive city;<br />
He, doting on your beauty, and to have fellows<br />
In his foul sin, hath raised these mutinous slaves.<br />
Wring not your hands, 'tis bootless; use the means<br />
That may preserve you. 'Tis no crime to break<br />
A vow when you are forced to it; show your face,<br />
And with the majesty of commanding beauty<br />
Strike dead his loose affections: if that fail,<br />
Give liberty to your tongue, and use entreaties:<br />
There cannot be a breast of flesh and blood,<br />
Or heart so made of flint, but must receive<br />
Impression from your words; or eyes so stern,<br />
But, from the clear reflection of your tears,<br />
Must melt, and bear them company. Will you not<br />
Do these good offices to yourself? poor I, then,<br />
Can only weep your fortune.&mdash;Here he comes.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span>, <i>speaking at the door</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> He that advances<br />
A foot beyond this comes upon my sword:<br />
You have had your ways, disturb not mine.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Speak gently;<br />
Her fears may kill her else.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Now Love inspire me!<br />
Still shall this canopy of envious night<br />
Obscure my suns of comfort? and those dainties<br />
Of purest white and red, which I take in at<br />
My greedy eyes, denied my famish'd senses?&mdash;<br />
The organs of your hearing yet are open;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>And you infringe no vow, though you vouchsafe<br />
To give them warrant to convey unto<br />
Your understanding parts the story of<br />
A tortured and despairing lover, whom<br />
Not fortune but affection marks your slave:&mdash;<br />
Shake not, best lady! for, believe 't, you are<br />
As far from danger as I am from force:<br />
All violence I shall offer tends no further<br />
Than to relate my sufferings, which I dare not<br />
Presume to do, till, by some gracious sign,<br />
You show you are pleased to hear me.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> If you are,<br />
Hold forth your right hand.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">[<span class="smcap">Cleora</span> <i>holds forth her right hand.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> So, 'tis done; and I<br />
With my glad lips seal humbly on your robe<br />
My soul's thanks for the favour: I forbear<br />
To tell you who I am, what wealth, what honours<br />
I made exchange of, to become your servant:<br />
And though I knew worthy Leosthenes<br />
(For sure he must be worthy, for whose love<br />
You have endured so much) to be my rival,<br />
When rage and jealousy counsell'd me to kill him,<br />
Which then I could have done with much more ease,<br />
Than now, in fear to grieve you, I dare speak it,<br />
Love, seconded with duty, boldly told me<br />
The man I hated, fair Cleora favour'd;<br />
And that was his protection.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<span class="smcap">Cleora</span> <i>bows.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> See, she bows<br />
Her head in sign of thankfulness.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> He removed by<br />
The occasion of the war, (my fires increasing<br />
By being closed and stopp'd up,) frantic affection<br />
Prompted me to do something in his absence<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>That might deliver you into my power,<br />
Which you see is effected: and even now,<br />
When my rebellious passions chide my dulness,<br />
And tell me how much I abuse my fortunes,<br />

(Nay, fear not, madam; true love is a servant,<br />
But brutish lust a tyrant,) only thus much<br />
Be pleased I may speak in my own dear cause;<br />
And think it worthy your consideration,<br />
(I have loved truly, cannot say deserved,<br />
Since duty must not take the name of merit,)<br />
That I so far prize your content, before<br />
All blessings that my hope can fashion to me,<br />
That willingly I entertain despair,<br />
And, for your sake, embrace it; for I know,<br />
This opportunity lost, by no endeavour<br />
The like can be recover'd. To conclude,<br />
Forget not that I lose myself to save you:<br />
For what can I expect but death and torture,<br />
The war being ended? and, what is a task<br />
Would trouble Hercules to undertake,<br />
I do deny you to myself, to give you,<br />
A pure unspotted present, to my rival.<br />

<p><i>Grac.</i> Come on, sir.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> Oh!</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Do you grumble? you were ever<br />
A brainless ass; but if this hold, I'll teach you<br />
To come aloft and do tricks like an ape.<br />
Your morning's lesson: if you miss&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> O no, sir.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> What for the Carthaginians? [<span class="smcap">Asotus</span> <i>makes moppes</i><a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.] A good beast.<br />
What for ourself, your lord<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>? [<i>Dances.</i>] Exceeding well.<br />

<p><i>Zant.</i> Was ever lady, the first day of her honour,<br />
So waited on by a wrinkled crone? She looks now,<br />
Without her painting, curling, and perfumes,<br />
Like the last day of January. Further off!<br />
So&mdash;stand there like an image; if you stir,<br />
Till, with a quarter of a look, I call you,<br />
You know what follows.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> O, what am I fallen to!<br />
But 'tis a punishment for my cruel pride,<br />
Justly return'd upon me.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> How dost thou like<br />
Thy ladyship, Zanthia?</p>

<p><i>Zant.</i> Very well; and bear it<br />
With as much state as your lordship.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Give me thy hand:<br />
Let us, like conquering Romans, walk in triumph<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>,<br />
Our captives following; then mount our tribunals,<br />
And make the slaves our footstools.</p>

<p><i>Zant.</i> Fine, by Jove!<br />
Are your hands clean, minion?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
<i>Coris.</i> Yes, forsooth.</p>

<p><i>Zant.</i> Fall off then. She and I have changed our parts;<br />
She does what she forced me to do in her reign,<br />
And I must practise it in mine.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> 'Tis justice:<br />
O! here come more.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cimbrio, Cleon, Poliphron</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Olympia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Discover to a drachma,<br />
Or I will famish thee.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> O! I am pined already.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> Spare the old jade, he's founder'd.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Cut his throat then,<br />
And hang him out for a scarecrow.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> You have all your wishes<br />
In your revenge, and I have mine. You see<br />
I use no tyranny: once I was her slave,<br />
And in requital of her courtesies,<br />
Having made one another free, we are married:<br />
And, if you wish us joy, join with us in<br />
A dance at our wedding.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Agreed; for I have thought of<br />
A most triumphant one, which shall express<br />
We are lords, and these our slaves.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> But we shall want<br />
A woman.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> No, here's Jane-of-apes shall serve<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>;<br />

Let's drink and cool us.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> A good motion.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Wait here;<br />
You have been tired with feasting, learn to fast now.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> Whom can we accuse<br />
But ourselves, for what we suffer? Thou art just,<br />
Thou all-creating Power! and misery<br />
Instructs me now, that yesterday acknowledged<br />
No deity beyond my pride and pleasure,<br />
There is a heaven above us, that looks down<br />
With the eyes of justice, upon such as number<br />
Those blessings freely given, in the accompt<br />
Of their poor merits: else it could not be,<br />
Now miserable I, to please whose palate<br />
The elements were ransack'd, yet complain'd<br />
Of nature, as not liberal enough<br />
In her provision of rarities<br />
To soothe my taste, and pamper my proud flesh,<br />
Should wish in vain for bread.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> Yes, I do wish too,<br />
For what I fed my dogs with.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> I, that forgot<br />
I was made of flesh and blood, and thought the silk<br />
Spun by the diligent worm out of their entrails,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>Too coarse to clothe me, and the softest down<br />
Too hard to sleep on; that disdain'd to look<br />
On virtue being in rags, that from my servants<br />
Expected adoration, am made justly<br />
The scorn of my own bondwoman.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> I know I cannot<br />
Last long, that's all my comfort.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> What a true mirror<br />
Were this sad spectacle for secure greatness!<br />
Here they, that never see themselves, but in<br />
The glass of servile flattery, might behold<br />
The weak foundation upon which they build<br />
Their trust in human frailty. Happy are those,<br />
That knowing, in their births, they are subject to<br />
Uncertain change, are still prepared, and arm'd<br />
For either fortune: a rare principle,<br />
And, with much labour, learn'd in wisdom's school!<br />
For, as these bondmen, by their actions, show<br />
That their prosperity, like too large a sail<br />
For their small bark of judgment, sinks them with<br />
A fore-right gale of liberty, ere they reach<br />
The port they long to touch at: so these wretches,<br />
Swollen with the false opinion of their worth,<br />
And proud of blessings left them, not acquired;<br />
That did believe they could with giant arms<br />
Fathom the earth, and were above their fates,<br />
Those borrow'd helps, that did support them, vanish'd,<br />
Fall of themselves, and by unmanly suffering<br />
Betray their proper weakness, and make known<br />
Their boasted greatness was lent, not their own.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> O for some meat! they sit long.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> We forgot,<br />
When we drew out intemperate feasts till midnight;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>Their hunger was not thought on, nor their watchings;<br />
Nor did we hold ourselves served to the height,<br />
But when we did exact and force their duties<br />
Beyond their strength and power.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> We pay for 't now:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Poliphron, Cimbrio, Gracculo, Zanthia</span>,

<p><i>Zant.</i> Here's Marullo.</p>

<p><i>Olymp.</i> He's your chief.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Take heed; I've news will cool this heat, and make you<br />
Remember what you were.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Send off these,<br />
And then I'll tell you.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Cleon, Asot. Zant. Olymp.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Coris</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> What would you impart?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> What must invite you<br />
To stand upon your guard, and leave your feasting;<br />
Our masters are victorious.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Within<br />
A day's march of the city, flesh'd with spoil,<br />
And proud of conquest; the armado sunk,<br />
The Carthaginian admiral, hand to hand,<br />
Slain by Leosthenes.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> I feel the whip<br />
Upon my back already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
<i>Grac.</i> Every man<br />
Seek a convenient tree, and hang himself.</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> Better die once, than live an age to suffer<br />
New tortures every hour.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> Say, we submit,<br />
And yield us to their mercy?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Can you flatter<br />
Yourselves with such false hopes? Or dare you think<br />
That your imperious lords, that never fail'd<br />
To punish with severity petty slips<br />
In your neglect of labour, may be won<br />
To pardon those licentious outrages<br />
Which noble enemies forbear to practise<br />
Upon the conquer'd? We have gone too far<br />
To think now of retiring; in our courage,<br />
And daring, lies our safety: if you are not<br />
Slaves in your abject minds, as in your fortunes,<br />
Since to die is the worst, better expose<br />
Our naked breasts to their keen swords, and sell<br />
Our lives with the most advantage, than to trust<br />
In a forestall'd remission, or yield up<br />
Our bodies to the furnace of their fury,<br />
Thrice heated with revenge.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> You led us on.</p>

<p><i>Cimb.</i> And 'tis but justice you should bring us off.</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> And we expect it.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Hear then, and obey me;<br />
And I will either save you, or fall with you.<br />
Man the walls strongly, and make good the ports;<br />
Boldly deny their entrance, and rip up<br />
Your grievances, and what compell'd you to<br />
This desperate course: if they disdain to hear<br />
Of composition, we have in our powers<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>Their aged fathers, children, and their wives,<br />
Who, to preserve themselves, must willingly<br />
Make intercession for us. 'Tis not time now<br />
To talk, but do: a glorious end, or freedom,<br />
Is now proposed us; stand resolved for either,<br />
And, like good fellows, live or die together.<br />

<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Country near Syracuse. The Camp of</i>
<span class="smcap">Timoleon</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timagoras</span>.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> I am so far from envy, I am proud<br />
You have outstripp'd me in the race of honour.<br />
O 'twas a glorious day, and bravely won!<br />
Your bold performance gave such lustre to<br />
Timoleon's wise directions, as the army<br />
Rests doubtful, to whom they stand most engaged<br />
For their so great success.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> The gods first honour'd,<br />
The glory be the general's; 'tis far from me<br />
To be his rival.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> You abuse your fortune,<br />
To entertain her choice and gracious favours<br />
With a contracted brow; plumed Victory<br />
Is truly painted with a cheerful look,<br />
Equally distant from proud insolence,<br />
And base dejection.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> O Timagoras,<br />
You only are acquainted with the cause<br />
That loads my sad heart with a hill of lead;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>Whose ponderous weight, neither my new-got honour,<br />
Assisted by the general applause<br />
The soldier crowns it with, nor all war's glories,<br />
Can lessen or remove: and, would you please,<br />
With fit consideration, to remember<br />
How much I wrong'd Cleora's innocence<br />
With my rash doubts; and what a grievous penance<br />
She did impose upon her tender sweetness,<br />
To pluck away the vulture, jealousy,<br />
That fed upon my liver; you cannot blame me,<br />
But call it a fit justice on myself,<br />
Though I resolve to be a stranger to<br />
The thought of mirth or pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> You have redeem'd<br />
The forfeit of your fault with such a ransom<br />
Of honourable action, as my sister<br />
Must of necessity confess her sufferings,<br />
Weigh'd down by your fair merits; and, when she views you,<br />
Like a triumphant conqueror, carried through<br />
The streets of Syracusa, the glad people<br />
Pressing to meet you, and the senators<br />
Contending who shall heap most honours on you;<br />
The oxen, crown'd with garlands, led before you,<br />
Appointed for the sacrifice; and the altars<br />
Smoking with thankful incense to the gods:<br />
The soldiers chanting loud hymns to your praise,<br />
The windows fill'd with matrons and with virgins,<br />
Throwing upon your head, as you pass by,<br />
The choicest flowers, and silently invoking<br />
The queen of love, with their particular vows,<br />
To be thought worthy of you; can Cleora<br />
(Though, in the glass of self-love, she behold<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>Her best deserts) but with all joy acknowledge<br />
What she endured was but a noble trial<br />
You made of her affection? and her anger,<br />
Rising from your too amorous cares, soon drench'd<br />
In Lethe, and forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> If those glories<br />
You so set forth were mine, they might plead for me;<br />
But I can lay no claim to the least honour<br />
Which you, with foul injustice, ravish from her.<br />
Her beauty in me wrought a miracle,<br />
Taught me to aim at things beyond my power,<br />
Which her perfections purchased, and gave to me<br />
From her free bounties; she inspired me with<br />
That valour which I dare not call mine own;<br />
And, from the fair reflection of her mind,<br />
My soul received the sparkling beams of courage.<br />
She, from the magazine of her proper goodness,<br />
Stock'd me with virtuous purposes; sent me forth<br />
To trade for honour; and, she being the owner<br />
Of the bark of my adventures, I must yield her<br />
A just account of all, as fits a factor.<br />
And, howsoever others think me happy,<br />
And cry aloud, I have made a prosperous voyage;<br />
One frown of her dislike at my return,<br />
Which, as a punishment for my fault, I look for,<br />
Strikes dead all comfort.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Tush! these fears are needless;<br />
She cannot, must not, shall not, be so cruel.<br />
A free confession of a fault wins pardon,<br />
But, being seconded by desert, commands it.<br />
The general is your own, and, sure, my father<br />
Repents his harshness; for myself, I am<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>Ever your creature.&mdash;One day shall be happy<br />
In your triumph, and your marriage.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> May it prove so,<br />
With her consent and pardon.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Ever touching<br />
On that harsh string! She is your own, and you<br />
Without disturbance seize on what's your due.<br />

<p><i>Mar.</i> She has her health, then?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Yes, sir; and as often<br />
As I speak of you, lends attentive ear<br />
To all that I deliver; nor seems tired,<br />
Though I dwell long on the relation of<br />
Your sufferings for her, heaping praise on praise<br />
On the unequall'd temperance, and command<br />
You hold o'er your affections.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> To my wish:<br />
Have you acquainted her with the defeature<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a><br />
Of the Carthaginians, and with what honours<br />
Leosthenes comes crown'd home with?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> With all care.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And how does she receive it?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> As I guess,<br />
With a seeming kind of joy; but yet appears not<br />
Transported, or proud of his happy fortune.<br />
But when I tell her of the certain ruin<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>You must encounter with at their arrival<br />
In Syracusa, and that death, with torments,<br />
Must fall upon you, which you yet repent not,<br />
Esteeming it a glorious martyrdom,<br />
And a reward of pure unspotted love,<br />
Preserved in the white robe of innocence,<br />
Though she were in your power; and, still spurr'd on<br />
By powerful love, you rather chose to suffer<br />
The fury of your lord, than that she should<br />
Be grieved or tainted in her reputation&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Pities she my misfortune?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> She express'd<br />
All signs of sorrow which, her vow observed,<br />
Could witness a grieved heart. At the first hearing,<br />
She fell upon her face, rent her fair hair,<br />
Her hands held up to heaven, and vented sighs,<br />
In which she silently seem'd to complain<br />
Of heaven's injustice.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> 'Tis enough: wait carefully,<br />
And, on all watch'd occasions, continue<br />
Speech and discourse of me: 'tis time must work her.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> I'll not be wanting, but still strive to serve you.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Poliphron</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Now, Poliphron, the news?</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> The conquering army<br />
Is within ken.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> How brook the slaves the object?</p>

<p><i>Poliph.</i> Cheerfully yet; they do refuse no labour,<br />
And seem to scoff at danger; 'tis your presence<br />
That must confirm them: with a full consent<br />
You are chosen to relate the tyranny<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>Of our proud masters; and what you subscribe to,<br />
They gladly will allow of, or hold out<br />
To the last man.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I'll instantly among them.<br />
If we prove constant to ourselves, good fortune<br />
Will not, I hope, forsake us.</p>

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Before the Walls of Syracuse.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Timoleon, Archidamus, Diphilus,
Leosthenes, Timagoras</span>, <i>and Soldiers</i>.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Thus far we are return'd victorious; crown'd<br />
With wreaths triumphant, (famine, blood, and death,<br />
Banish'd your peaceful confines,) and bring home<br />
Security and peace. 'Tis therefore fit<br />
That such as boldly stood the shock of war,<br />
And with the dear expense of sweat and blood<br />
Have purchased honour, should with pleasure reap<br />
The harvest of their toil: and we stand bound,<br />
Out of the first file of the best deservers,<br />
(Though all must be consider'd to their merits,)<br />
To think of you, Leosthenes, that stand,<br />
And worthily, most dear in our esteem,<br />
For your heroic valour.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> When I look on<br />
The labour of so many men and ages,<br />
This well-built city, not long since design'd<br />
To spoil and rapine, by the favour of<br />
The gods, and you, their ministers, preserved,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>I cannot, in my height of joy, but offer<br />
These tears for a glad sacrifice.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> Sleep the citizens?<br />
Or are they overwhelm'd with the excess<br />
Of comfort that flows to them?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> We receive<br />
A silent entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> I long since<br />
Expected that the virgins and the matrons,<br />
The old men striving with their age, the priests,<br />
Carrying the images of their gods before them,<br />
Should have met us with procession.&mdash;Ha! the gates<br />
Are shut against us!</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> And, upon the walls,<br />
Arm'd men seem to defy us!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter above, on the Walls</i>, <span class="smcap">Marullo</span>, <span class="smcap">Poliphron</span>,
<span class="smcap">Cimbrio</span>, <span class="smcap">Gracculo</span>, <i>and other Slaves</i>.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> I should know<br />
These faces: they are our slaves.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> The mystery, rascals!<br />
Open the ports, and play not with an anger<br />
That will consume you.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> This is above wonder.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Our bondmen stand against us!</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> Some such things<br />
We were in man's remembrance. The slaves are turn'd<br />
Lords of the town, or so&mdash;nay, be not angry:<br />
Perhaps, upon good terms, giving security<br />
You will be quiet men, we may allow you<br />
Some lodgings in our garrets or outhouses:<br />
Your great looks cannot carry it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
<i>Cimb.</i> The truth is,<br />
We have been bold to rifle your rich chests,<br />
Been busy with your wardrobes.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Can we endure this?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> O my Cleora!</p>

<p><i>Grac.</i> A caudle for the gentleman;<br />
He'll die o' the pip else.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Scorn'd too! are you turn'd stone?<br />
Hold parley with our bondmen! force our entrance,<br />

Since I must speak for all&mdash;Your tyranny<br />
Drew us from our obedience. Happy those times<br />
When lords were styled fathers of families,<br />
And not imperious masters! when they number'd<br />
Their servants almost equal with their sons,<br />
Or one degree beneath them! when their labours<br />
Were cherish'd and rewarded, and a period<br />
Set to their sufferings; when they did not press<br />
Their duties or their wills, beyond the power<br />
And strength of their performance! all things order'd<br />

The perfect model of a commonwealth.<br />
Humanity then lodged in the hearts of men,<br />

For creatures wanting reason. The noble horse,<br />
That, in his fiery youth, from his wide nostrils<br />
Neigh'd courage to his rider, and brake through<br />

Safe to triumphant victory; old or wounded,<br />
Was set at liberty, and freed from service.<br />
The Athenian mules, that from the quarry drew<br />
Marble, hew'd for the temples of the gods,<br />
The great work ended, were dismiss'd, and fed<br />
At the public cost; nay, faithful dogs have found<br />
Their sepulchres; but man, to man more cruel,<br />
Appoints no end to the sufferings of his slave;<br />
Since pride stepp'd in and riot, and o'erturn'd<br />
This goodly frame of concord, teaching masters<br />

Practised on us with rigour; this hath forced us<br />
To shake our heavy yokes off; and, if redress<br />
Of these just grievances be not granted us,<br />

Committed in your absence. Liberty<br />
To all such as desire to make return<br />
Into their countries; and, to those that stay,<br />
A competence of land freely allotted<br />
To each man's proper use, no lord acknowledged:<br />
Lastly, with your consent, to choose them wives<br />
Out of your families.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Let the city sink first.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timandra</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I know I am pursued; nor would I fly,<br />
Although the ports were open, and a convoy<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>Ready to bring me off: the baseness of<br />
These villains, from the pride of all my hopes,<br />
Hath thrown me to the bottomless abyss<br />
Of horror and despair: had they stood firm,<br />
I could have bought Cleora's free consent<br />
With the safety of her father's life, and brother's;<br />
And forced Leosthenes to quit his claim,<br />
And kneel a suitor for me.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> You must not think<br />
What might have been, but what must now be practised,<br />
And suddenly resolve.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> All my poor fortunes<br />
Are at the stake, and I must run the hazard.<br />
Unseen, convey me to Cleora's chamber;<br />
For in her sight, if it were possible,<br />
I would be apprehended: do not inquire<br />
The reason why, but help me.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Knocking within.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Make haste,&mdash;one knocks.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span>.</span><br />
Jove turn all to the best!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">You are welcome, sir.</span></p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Thou giv'st it in a heavy tone.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Alas! sir,<br />
We have so long fed on the bread of sorrow,<br />
Drinking the bitter water of afflictions,<br />
Made loathsome too by our continued fears,<br />
Comfort 's a stranger to us.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Fears! your sufferings:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>For which I am so overgone with grief,<br />
I dare not ask, without compassionate tears,<br />
The villain's name that robb'd thee of thy honour:<br />
For being train'd up in chastity's cold school,<br />
And taught by such a mistress as Cleora,<br />
'Twere impious in me to think Timandra<br />
Fell with her own consent.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> How mean you, fell, sir?<br />
I understand you not.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> I would thou didst not,<br />
Or that I could not read upon thy face,<br />
In blushing characters, the story of<br />
Libidinous rape: confess it, for you stand not<br />
Accountable for a sin, against whose strength<br />
Your o'ermatch'd innocence could make no resistance;<br />
Under which odds, I know, Cleora fell too,<br />
Heaven's help in vain invoked; the amazed sun<br />
Hiding his face behind a mask of clouds,<br />
Nor daring to look on it! In her sufferings<br />
All sorrow's comprehended: what Timandra,<br />
Or the city, has endured, her loss consider'd,<br />
Deserves not to be named.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Pray you, do not bring, sir,<br />
In the chimeras of your jealous fears,<br />
New monsters to affright us.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> O, Timandra,<br />
That I had faith enough but to believe thee!<br />
I should receive it with a joy beyond<br />
Assurance of Elysian shades hereafter,<br />
Or all the blessings, in this life, a mother<br />
Could wish her children crown'd with&mdash;but I must not<br />
Credit impossibilities; yet I strive<br />
To find out that whose knowledge is a curse,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>And ignorance a blessing. Come, discover<br />
What kind of look he had that forced thy lady,<br />
(Thy ravisher I will inquire at leisure),<br />
That when, hereafter, I behold a stranger<br />
But near him in aspect, I may conclude,<br />
Though men and angels should proclaim him honest,<br />
He is a hell bred villain.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> You are unworthy<br />
To know she is preserved, preserved untainted:<br />
Sorrow, but ill bestow'd, hath only made<br />
A rape upon her comforts in your absence.<br />
Come forth, dear madam.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Leads in</i> <span class="smcap">Cleora</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Ha!
<span style="margin-left:8em;">[<i>Kneels.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Nay, she deserves<br />
The bending of your heart; that, to content you,<br />
Has kept a vow, the breach of which a Vestal,<br />
Though the infringing it had call'd upon her<br />
A living funeral,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> must of force have shrunk at.<br />
No danger could compel her to dispense with<br />
Her cruel penance, though hot lust came arm'd<br />
To seize upon her; when one look or accent<br />
Might have redeem'd her.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Might! O do not show me<br />
A beam of comfort, and straight take it from me.<br />
The means by which she was freed? speak, O speak quickly;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>Each minute of delay 's an age of torment;<br />
O speak, Timandra.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Free her from her oath;<br />
Herself can best deliver it.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> O blest office!
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Unbinds her eyes.</i></span><br />
Never did galley-slave shake off his chains,<br />
Or look'd on his redemption from the oar,<br />
With such true feeling of delight, as now<br />
I find myself possessed of.&mdash;Now I behold<br />
True light indeed; for, since these fairest stars,<br />
Cover'd with clouds of your determinate will,<br />
Denied their influence to my optic sense,<br />
The splendour of the sun appear'd to me<br />
But as some little glimpse of his bright beams<br />
Convey'd into a dungeon, to remember<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a><br />
The dark inhabitants there, how much they wanted.<br />
Open these long-shut lips, and strike mine ears<br />
With music more harmonious than the spheres<br />
Yield in their heavenly motions: and if ever<br />
A true submission for a crime acknowledged<br />
May find a gracious hearing, teach your tongue,<br />
In the first sweet articulate sounds it utters,<br />
To sign my wish'd-for pardon.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> I forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> How greedily I receive this! Stay, best lady,<br />
And let me by degrees ascend the height<br />
Of human happiness! all at once deliver'd,<br />
The torrent of my joys will overwhelm me:&mdash;<br />
So! now a little more; and pray excuse me,<br />
If, like a wanton epicure, I desire<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>The pleasant taste these cates of comfort yield me,<br />
Should not too soon be swallow'd. Have you not,<br />
By your unspotted truth I do conjure you<br />
To answer truly, suffer'd in your honour,<br />
By force, I mean, for in your will I free you,<br />
Since I left Syracusa?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> I restore<br />
This kiss, so help me goodness! which I borrow'd,<br />
When I last saw you.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Miracle of virtue!<br />
One pause more, I beseech you: I am like<br />
A man whose vital spirits consumed and wasted<br />
With a long and tedious fever, unto whom<br />
Too much of a strong cordial, at once taken,<br />
Brings death, and not restores him. Yet I cannot<br />
Fix here; but must inquire the man to whom<br />
I stand indebted for a benefit,<br />
Which to requite at full, though in this hand<br />
I grasp all sceptres the world's empire bows to,<br />
Would leave me a poor bankrupt. Name him, lady;<br />
If of a mean estate, I'll gladly part with<br />
My utmost fortunes to him; but if noble,<br />
In thankful duty study how to serve him;<br />
Or if of higher rank, erect him altars,<br />
And as a god adore him.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> If that goodness,<br />
And noble temperance, the queen of virtues,<br />
Bridling rebellious passions, to whose sway,<br />
Such as have conquer'd nations have lived slaves,<br />
Did ever wing great minds to fly to heaven,<br />
He, that preserved mine honour, may hope boldly<br />
To fill a seat among the gods, and shake off<br />
Our frail corruption.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
<i>Cleo.</i> Or if ever<br />
The Powers above did mask in human shapes,<br />
To teach mortality, not by cold precepts<br />
Forgot as soon as told, but by examples,<br />
To imitate their pureness, and draw near<br />
To their celestial natures, I believe<br />
He's more than man.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> You do describe a wonder.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Which will increase, when you shall understand<br />
He was a lover.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Not yours, lady?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Yes;<br />
Loved me, Leosthenes; nay, more, so doted,<br />
(If e'er affections scorning gross desires<br />
May without wrong be styled so,) that he durst not,<br />
With an immodest syllable or look,<br />
In fear it might take from me, whom he made<br />
The object of his better part, discover<br />
I was the saint he sued to.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> A rare temper!</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> I cannot speak it to the worth: all praise<br />
I can bestow upon it will appear<br />
Envious detraction. Not to rack you further,<br />
Yet make the miracle full, though, of all men,<br />
He hated you, Leosthenes, as his rival,<br />
So high yet he prized my content, that, knowing<br />
You were a man I favour'd, he disdain'd not,<br />
Against himself, to serve you.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> You conceal still<br />
The owner of these excellencies.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> 'Tis Marullo,<br />
My father's bondman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
<i>Leost.</i> Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Why do you laugh?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> To hear the labouring mountain of your praise<br />
Deliver'd of a mouse.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> The man deserves not<br />
This scorn, I can assure you.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Do you call<br />
What was his duty, merit?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Yes, and place it<br />
As high in my esteem, as all the honours<br />
Descended from your ancestors, or the glory,<br />
Which you may call your own, got in this action,<br />
In which, I must confess, you have done nobly;<br />
And I could add, as I desired, but that<br />
I fear 't would make you proud.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Why, lady, can you<br />
Be won to give allowance, that your slave<br />
Should dare to love you?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> The immortal gods<br />
Accept the meanest altars, that are raised<br />
By pure devotions; and sometimes prefer<br />
An ounce of frankincense, honey, or milk,<br />
Before whole hecatombs, or Sab&aelig;an gums,<br />
Offer'd in ostentation.&mdash;Are you sick<br />
Of your old disease? I'll fit you.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> You seem moved.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Zealous, I grant, in the defence of virtue.<br />
Why, good Leosthenes, though I endured<br />
A penance for your sake, above example;<br />
I have not so far sold myself, I take it,<br />
To be at your devotion, but I may<br />
Cherish desert in others, where I find it.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>How would you tyrannize, if you stood possess'd of<br />
That which is only yours in expectation,<br />
That now prescribe such hard conditions to me?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> One kiss, and I am silenced.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> I vouchsafe it;<br />
Yet, I must tell you 'tis a favour that<br />
Marullo, when I was his, not mine own,<br />
Durst not presume to ask: no; when the city<br />
Bow'd humbly to licentious violence,<br />
And when I was, of men and gods forsaken,<br />
Deliver'd to his power, he did not press me<br />
To grace him with one look or syllable,<br />
Or urged the dispensation of an oath<br />
Made for your satisfaction:&mdash;the poor wretch,<br />
Having related only his own sufferings,<br />
And kiss'd my hand, which I could not deny him,<br />
Defending me from others, never since<br />
Solicited my favours.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Pray you, end:<br />
The story does not please me.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Well, take heed<br />
Of doubts and fears;&mdash;for know, Leosthenes,<br />
A greater injury cannot be offer'd<br />
To innocent chastity, than unjust suspicion.<br />
I love Marullo's fair mind, not his person;<br />
Let that secure you. And I here command you,<br />
If I have any power in you, to stand<br />
Between him and all punishment, and oppose<br />
His temperance to his folly: if you fail&mdash;&mdash;<br />
No more; I will not threaten.

Of glass I walk upon, over a river<br />
Of certain ruin, mine own weighty fears<br />

<p><i>Cleon.</i> But are you sure we are safe?</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> You need not fear;<br />
They are all under guard, their fangs pared off:<br />
The wounds their insolence gave you, to be cured<br />
With the balm of your revenge.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> And shall I be<br />
The thing I was born, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> The same wise thing.<br />
'Slight, what a beast they have made thee! Afric never<br />
Produced the like.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> I think so:&mdash;nor the land<br />
Where apes and monkeys grow, like crabs and walnuts,<br />
On the same tree. Not all the catalogue<br />
Of conjurers or wise women bound together<br />
Could have so soon transform'd me, as my rascal<br />
Did with his whip; for not in outside only,<br />
But in my own belief, I thought myself<br />
As perfect a baboon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> An ass thou wert ever.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> And would have given one leg, with all my heart,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>For good security to have been a man<br />
After three lives, or one and twenty years,<br />
Though I had died on crutches.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> Never varlets<br />
So triumph'd o'er an old fat man: I was famish'd.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Indeed you are fallen away.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> Three years of feeding<br />
On cullises and jelly, though his cooks<br />
Lard all he eats with marrow, or his doctors<br />
Pour in his mouth restoratives as he sleeps,<br />
Will not recover him.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> But your ladyship looks<br />
Sad on the matter, as if you had miss'd<br />
Your ten-crown amber possets, good to smooth<br />
The cutis, as you call it.</p>

I am an alter'd woman.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Is that the villain's sanctuary?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> This confirms<br />
All she deliver'd, false.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> But that I scorn<br />
To rust my good sword in thy slavish blood,<br />
Thou now wert dead.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> He's more a slave than fortune<br />
Or misery can make me, that insults<br />
Upon unweapon'd innocence.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Prate you, dog?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Curs snap at lions in the toil, whose looks<br />
Frighted them, being free.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> As a wild beast,<br />
Drive him before you.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> O divine Cleora!</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Darest thou presume to name her?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Yes, and love her;<br />
And may say, have deserved her.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Stop his mouth,<br />
Load him with irons too.<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
<i>Cleon.</i> I am deadly sick<br />
To look on him.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> If he get loose, I know it,<br />
I caper like an ape again: I feel<br />
The whip already.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> This goes to my lady.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Come, cheer you, sir; we'll urge his punishment<br />
To the full satisfaction of your anger.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> He is not worth my thoughts. No corner left<br />
In all the spacious rooms of my vex'd heart,<br />
But is fill'd with Cleora: and the rape<br />
She has done upon her honour, with my wrong,<br />
The heavy burden of my sorrow's song.

<h3>ACT V. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Archidamus</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Archidamus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Cleora</span>.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Thou art thine own disposer. Were his honours<br />
And glories centupled, as I must confess,<br />
Leosthenes is most worthy, yet I will not,<br />
However I may counsel, force affection.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> It needs not, sir; I prize him to his worth,<br />
Nay, love him truly; yet would not live slaved<br />
To his jealous humours: since, by the hopes of heaven,<br />
As I am free from violence, in a thought<br />
I am not guilty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
<i>Archid.</i> 'Tis believed, Cleora;<br />
And much the rather, our great gods be praised for 't!<br />
In that I find, beyond my hopes, no sign<br />
Of riot in my house, but all things order'd,<br />
As if I had been present.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> May that move you<br />
To pity poor Marullo!</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> 'Tis my purpose<br />
To do him all the good I can, Cleora;<br />
But this offence, being against the state,<br />
Must have a public trial. In the mean time,<br />
Be careful of yourself, and stand engaged<br />
No further to Leosthenes, than you may<br />
Come off with honour; for, being once his wife,<br />
You are no more your own, nor mine, but must<br />
Resolve to serve, and suffer his commands,<br />
And not dispute them:&mdash;ere it be too late,<br />
Consider it duly. I must to the senate.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> I am much distracted: in Leosthenes<br />
I can find nothing justly to accuse,<br />
But his excess of love, which I have studied<br />
To cure with more than common means; yet still<br />
It grows upon him. And, if I may call<br />
My sufferings merit, I stand bound to think on<br />
Marullo's dangers&mdash;though I save his life,<br />
His love is unrewarded:&mdash;I confess,<br />
Both have deserved me; yet, of force, must be<br />
Unjust to one; such is my destiny.&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Timandra</span>.</p>

<p>How now! whence flow these tears?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> I have met, madam,<br />
An object of such cruelty, as would force<br />
A savage to compassion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<i>Cleo.</i> Speak, what is it?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Men pity beasts of rapine, if o'ermatch'd,<br />
Though baited for their pleasure: but these monsters<br />
Upon a man that can make no resistance,<br />
Are senseless in their tyranny. Let it be granted<br />
Marullo is a slave, he's still a man;<br />
A capital offender, yet in justice<br />
Not to be tortured, till the judge pronounce<br />
His punishment.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Where is he?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Dragg'd to prison<br />
With more than barbarous violence; spurn'd and spit on<br />
By the insulting officers, his hands<br />
Pinion'd behind his back; loaden with fetters:<br />
Yet, with a saint-like patience, he still offers<br />
His face to their rude buffets.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> O my grieved soul!&mdash;<br />
By whose command?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> It seems, my lord your brother's,<br />
For he's a looker-on: and it takes from<br />
Honour'd Leosthenes to suffer it,<br />
For his respect to you, whose name in vain<br />
The grieved wretch loudly calls on.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> By Diana,<br />
'Tis base in both; and to their teeth I'll tell them<br />
That I am wrong'd in 't.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Going forth.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> What will you do?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> In person<br />
Visit and comfort him.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> That will bring fuel<br />
To the jealous fires which burn too hot already<br />
In lord Leosthenes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
<i>Cleo.</i> Let them consume him!<br />
I am mistress of myself. Where cruelty reigns,<br />
There dwells nor love nor honour.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> So! it works.<br />
Though hitherto I have run a desperate course<br />
To serve my brother's purposes, now 'tis fit</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timagoras</span>.</p>

<p>I study mine own ends. They come:&mdash;assist me<br />
In these my undertakings, Love's great patron,<br />
As my intents are honest!</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> 'Tis my fault<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>:<br />
Distrust of other springs, Timagoras,<br />
From diffidence in ourselves: but I will strive,<br />
With the assurance of my worth and merits,<br />
To kill this monster, jealousy.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> 'Tis a guest,<br />
In wisdom, never to be entertain'd<br />
On trivial probabilities; but, when<br />
He does appear in pregnant proofs, not fashion'd<br />
By idle doubts and fears to be received:<br />
They make their own wrongs that are too secure,<br />
As well as such as give them growth and being<br />
From mere imagination. Though I prize<br />
Cleora's honour equal with mine own,<br />
And know what large additions of power<br />
This match brings to our family, I prefer<br />
Our friendship, and your peace of mind, so far<br />
Above my own respects, or hers, that if<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>She hold not her true value in the test,<br />
'Tis far from my ambition, for her cure,<br />
That you should wound yourself.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> This argues for me.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Why she should be so passionate for a bondman,<br />
Falls not in compass of my understanding,<br />
But for some nearer interest; or he raise<br />
This mutiny, if he loved her, as, you say,<br />
She does confess he did, but to possess<br />
The prize he ventured for, to me's a riddle.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> I have answer'd that objection, in my strong<br />
Assurance of her virtue.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> 'Tis unfit, then,<br />
That I should press it further.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Now I must<br />
Make in, or all is lost.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">[<i>Rushes forward distractedly.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> What would Timandra?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> How wild she looks! How is it with thy lady?</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Collect thyself, and speak.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> As you are noble,<br />
Have pity, or love piety.&mdash;Oh!</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Take breath.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Out with it boldly.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> O, the best of ladies,<br />
I fear, is gone for ever.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Who, Cleora?</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Deliver, how? 'Sdeath, be a man, sir!&mdash;Speak.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Take it then in as many sighs as words,<br />
My lady&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
<i>Timag.</i> What of her?</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> No sooner heard<br />
Marullo was imprison'd, but she fell<br />
Into a deadly swoon.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> But she recover'd:<br />
Say so, or he will sink too. Hold, sir; fie!<br />
This is unmanly.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Brought again to life,<br />
But with much labour, she awhile stood silent,<br />
Yet in that interim vented sighs, as if<br />
They labour'd, from the prison of her flesh,<br />
To give her grieved soul freedom. On the sudden,<br />
Transported on the wings of rage and sorrow,<br />
She flew out of the house, and, unattended,<br />
Enter'd the common prison.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> This confirms<br />
What but before I fear'd.</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> There you may find her;<br />
And, if you love her as a sister&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Damn her!</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> Or you respect her safety as a lover,<br />
Procure Marullo's liberty.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Impudence<br />
Beyond expression!</p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> She'll run mad, else,<br />
Or do some violent act upon herself:<br />
My lord, her father, sensible of her sufferings,<br />
Labours to gain his freedom.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> O, the devil!<br />
Has she bewitch'd him too?</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> I'll hear no more.<br />
Come, sir, we'll follow her; and if no persuasion<br />
Can make her take again her natural form,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>Which by some powerful spell she has cast off,<br />
This sword shall disenchant her.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> O my heart-strings!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timagoras</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Timand.</i> I knew 't would take. Pardon me, fair Cleora,<br />
Though I appear a traitress; which thou wilt do,<br />
In pity of my woes, when I make known<br />
My lawful claim, and only seek mine own.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>


<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Prison.</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span> <i>discovered in chains</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cleora</span> <i>and Gaoler</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> There's for your privacy. Stay, unbind his hands.</p>

<p><i>Gaol.</i> I dare not, madam.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> I will buy thy danger:<br />
Take more gold;&mdash;do not trouble me with thanks;<br />
I do suppose it done.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Exit Gaoler.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> My better angel<br />
Assumes this shape to comfort me, and wisely;<br />
Since, from the choice of all celestial figures,<br />
He could not take a visible form so full<br />
Of glorious sweetness.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Kneels.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Rise. I am flesh and blood,<br />
And do partake thy tortures.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Can it be,<br />
That charity should persuade you to descend<br />
So far from your own height, as to vouchsafe<br />
To look upon my sufferings? How I bless<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>My fetters now, and stand engaged to fortune<br />
For my captivity&mdash;no, my freedom, rather!<br />
For who dare think that place a prison which<br />
You sanctify with your presence? or believe<br />
Sorrow has power to use her sting on him<br />
That is in your compassion arm'd, and made<br />
Impregnable, though tyranny raise at once<br />
All engines to assault him?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Indeed virtue,<br />
With which you have made evident proofs that you<br />
Are strongly fortified, cannot fall, though shaken<br />
With the shock of fierce temptations; but still triumphs<br />
In spite of opposition. For myself,<br />
I may endeavour to confirm your goodness,<br />
(A sure retreat, which never will deceive you,)<br />
And with unfeigned tears express my sorrow<br />
For what I cannot help.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Do you weep for me?<br />
O, save that precious balm for nobler uses!<br />
I am unworthy of the smallest drop<br />
Which, in your prodigality of pity,<br />
You throw away on me. Ten of these pearls<br />
Were a large ransom to redeem a kingdom<br />
From a consuming plague, or stop heaven's vengeance,<br />
Call'd down by crying sins, though, at that instant,<br />
In dreadful flashes falling on the roofs<br />
Of bold blasphemers. I am justly punish'd<br />
For my intent of violence to such pureness;<br />
And all the torments flesh is sensible of,<br />
A soft and gentle penance.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Which is ended<br />
In this your free confession.

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timagoras</span> <i>behind</i>.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> What an object<br />
Have I encounter'd!</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> I am blasted too:<br />
Yet hear a little further.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Could I expire now,<br />
These white and innocent hands closing my eyes thus,<br />
'Twere not to die, but in a heavenly dream<br />
To be transported, without the help of Charon,<br />
To the Elysian shades. You make me bold;<br />
And, but to wish such happiness, I fear,<br />
May give offence.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> No; for believe 't, Marullo,<br />
You've won so much upon me, that I know not<br />
That happiness in my gift, but you may challenge.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Are you yet satisfied?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Nor can you wish<br />
But what my vows will second, though it were<br />
Your freedom first, and then in me full power<br />
To make a second tender of myself,<br />
And you receive the present. By this kiss,<br />
From me a virgin bounty, I will practise<br />
All arts for your deliverance; and that purchased,<br />
In what concerns your further aims, I speak it,<br />
Do not despair, but hope&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<span class="smcap">Timagoras</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span> <i>come forward</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> To have the hangman,<br />
When he is married to the cross, in scorn<br />
To say, <i>Gods give you joy</i>!</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> But look on me,<br />
And be not too indulgent to your folly;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>And then, but that grief stops my speech, imagine<br />
What language I should use.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Against thyself:<br />
Thy malice cannot reach me.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> No, brother,<br />
Though you join in the dialogue to accuse me:<br />
What I have done, I'll justify; and these favours,<br />
Which, you presume, will taint me in my honour,<br />
Though jealousy use all her eyes to spy out<br />
One stain in my behaviour, or envy<br />
As many tongues to wound it, shall appear<br />
My best perfections. For, to the world,<br />
I can in my defence allege such reasons,<br />
As my accusers shall stand dumb to hear them;<br />
When in his fetters this man's worth and virtues,<br />
But truly told, shall shame your boasted glories,<br />
Which fortune claims a share in.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> The base villain<br />
Shall never live to hear it.

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Murder! help!<br />

<p><i>Archid.</i> What's the matter?<br />
On whom is your sword drawn? are you a judge?<br />
Or else ambitious of the hangman's office,<br />
Before it be design'd you?&mdash;You are bold, too;<br />
Unhand my daughter.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> She's my valour's prize.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> With her consent, not otherwise. You may urge<br />
Your title in the court; if it prove good,<br />
Possess her freely.&mdash;Guard him safely off too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
<i>Timag.</i> You'll hear me, sir?</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> If you have aught to say,<br />
Deliver it in public; all shall find<br />
A just judge of Timoleon.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> You must<br />
Of force now use your patience.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Exeunt all but</i> <span class="smcap">Timagoras</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Vengeance rather!<br />
Whirlwinds of rage possess me: you are wrong'd<br />
Beyond a stoic sufferance; yet you stand<br />
As you were rooted.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> I feel something here,<br />
That boldly tells me, all the love and service<br />
I pay Cleora is another's due,<br />
And therefore cannot prosper.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Melancholy;<br />
Which now you must not yield to.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> 'Tis apparent:<br />
In fact your sister's innocent, however<br />
Changed by her violent will.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> If you believe so,<br />
Follow the chase still; and in open court<br />
Plead your own interest: we shall find the judge<br />
Our friend, I fear not.</p>

<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Court of Justice.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Timoleon, Archidamus, Cleora</span>; <i>and
Officers</i>.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> 'Tis wonderous strange! nor can it fall within<br />
The reach of my belief, a slave should be<br />
The owner of a temperance which this age<br />
Can hardly parallel in freeborn lords,<br />
Or kings proud of their purple.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> 'Tis most true;<br />
And, though at first it did appear a fable,<br />
All circumstances meet to give it credit;<br />
Which works so on me, that I am compell'd<br />
To be a suitor, not to be denied,<br />
He may have equal hearing.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Sir, you graced me<br />
With the title of your mistress<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>; but my fortune<br />
Is so far distant from command, that I<br />
Lay by the power you gave me, and plead humbly<br />
For the preserver of my fame and honour.<br />
And pray you, sir, in charity believe,<br />
That, since I had ability of speech,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>My tongue has been so much inured to truth,<br />
I know not how to lie.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> I'll rather doubt<br />
The oracles of the gods, than question what<br />
Your innocence delivers; and, as far<br />
As justice and mine honour can give way,<br />
He shall have favour. Bring him in unbound:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Exeunt Officers.</i></span><br />
And though Leosthenes may challenge from me,<br />
For his late worthy service, credit to<br />
All things he can allege in his own cause,<br />
Marullo, so, I think, you call his name,<br />
Shall find I do reserve one ear for him,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cleon, Asotus, Diphilus, Olympia</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Corisca</span>.</p>

<p>To let in mercy. Sit, and take your places;<br />
The right of this fair virgin first determined,<br />
Your bondmen shall be censured<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> With all rigour.<br />
We do expect.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> Temper'd, I say, with mercy.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter at one door</i> <span class="smcap">Leosthenes</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timagoras</span>;
<i>at the other, Officers with</i> <span class="smcap">Marullo</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Timandra</span>.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Your hand, Leosthenes: I cannot doubt,<br />
You, that have been victorious in the war,<br />
Should, in a combat fought with words, come off<br />
But with assured triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
<i>Leost.</i> My deserts, sir,<br />
If, without arrogance, I may style them such,<br />
Arm me from doubt and fear.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> 'Tis nobly spoken.<br />
Nor be thou daunted (howsoe'er thy fortune<br />
Has mark'd thee out a slave) to speak thy merits:<br />
For virtue, though in rags, may challenge more<br />
Than vice, set off with all the trim of greatness.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I had rather fall under so just a judge,<br />
Than be acquitted by a man corrupt,<br />
And partial, in his censure.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Note his language;<br />
It relishes of better breeding than<br />
His present state dares promise.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> I observe it.<br />
Place the fair lady in the midst, that both,<br />
Looking with covetous eyes upon the prize<br />
They are to plead for, may, from the fair object,<br />
Teach Hermes eloquence.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Am I fallen so low?<br />
My birth, my honour, and, what 's dearest to me,<br />
My love, and, witness of my love, my service,<br />
So undervalued, that I must contend<br />
With one, where my excess of glory must<br />
Make his o'erthrow a conquest? Shall my fulness<br />
Supply defects in such a thing, that never<br />
Knew any thing but want and emptiness,<br />
Give him a name, and keep it such, from this<br />
Unequal competition? If my pride,<br />
Or any bold assurance of my worth,<br />
Has pluck'd this mountain of disgrace upon me,<br />
I am justly punish'd, and submit; but if<br />
I have been modest, and esteem'd myself<br />
More injured in the tribute of the praise,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>Which no desert of mine, prized by self-love,<br />
Ever exacted, may this cause and minute<br />
For ever be forgotten! I dwell long<br />
Upon mine anger, and now turn to you,<br />
Ungrateful fair one; and, since you are such,<br />
'Tis lawful for me to proclaim myself,<br />
And what I have deserved.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Neglect and scorn<br />
From me, for this proud vaunt.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> You nourish, lady,<br />
Your own dishonour in this harsh reply,<br />
And almost prove what some hold of your sex,<br />
You are all made up of passion: for, if reason<br />
Or judgment could find entertainment with you,<br />
Or that you would distinguish of the objects<br />
You look on, in a true glass, not seduced<br />
By the false light of your too violent will,<br />
I should not need to plead for that which you,<br />
With joy, should offer. Is my high birth a blemish?<br />
Or does my wealth, which all the vain expense<br />
Of women cannot waste, breed loathing in you?<br />
The honours I can call mine own, thought scandals?<br />
Am I deform'd, or, for my father's sins,<br />
Mulcted by nature? If you interpret these<br />
As crimes, 'tis fit I should yield up myself<br />
Most miserably guilty. But, perhaps,<br />
(Which yet I would not credit,) you have seen<br />
This gallant pitch the bar, or bear a burden<br />
Would crack the shoulders of a weaker bondman.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> You are foul-mouth'd.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> Ill-manner'd too.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> I speak<br />
In the way of supposition, and entreat you,<br />
With all the fervour of a constant lover,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>That you would free yourself from these aspersions,<br />
Or any imputation black-tongued slander<br />
Could throw on your unspotted virgin whiteness:<br />
To which there is no easier way, than by<br />
Vouchsafing him your favour; him, to whom,<br />
Next to the general, and the gods and fautors<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>,<br />
The country owes her safety.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Are you stupid?<br />
'Slight! leap into his arms, and there ask pardon.&mdash;<br />
Oh! you expect your slave's reply; no doubt<br />
We shall have a fine oration: I will teach<br />
My spaniel to howl in sweeter language,<br />
And keep a better method.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> You forget<br />
The dignity of the place.</p>

<p><i>Diph.</i> Silence!</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> [<i>to Marullo.</i>] Speak boldly.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> 'Tis your authority gives me a tongue;<br />
I should be dumb else; and I am secure,<br />
I cannot clothe my thoughts, and just defence,<br />
In such an abject phrase, but 'twill appear<br />
Equal, if not above my low condition.<br />
I need no bombast language, stolen from such<br />
As make nobility from prodigious terms<br />
The hearers understand not; I bring with me<br />
No wealth to boast of, neither can I number<br />
Uncertain fortune's favours with my merits;<br />
I dare not force affection, or presume<br />
To censure her discretion, that looks on me<br />
As a weak man, and not her fancy's idol.<br />
How I have loved, and how much I have suffer'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>And with what pleasure undergone the burden<br />
Of my ambitious hopes, (in aiming at<br />
The glad possession of a happiness,<br />
The abstract of all goodness in mankind<br />
Can at no part deserve), with my confession<br />
Of mine own wants, is all that can plead for me.<br />
But if that pure desires, not blended with<br />
Foul thoughts, that, like a river, keeps his course,<br />
Retaining still the clearness of the spring<br />
From whence it took beginning, may be thought<br />
Worthy acceptance; then I dare rise up,<br />
And tell this gay man to his teeth, I never<br />
Durst doubt her constancy, that, like a rock,<br />
Beats off temptations, as that mocks the fury<br />
Of the proud waves; nor, from my jealous fears,<br />
Question that goodness to which, as an altar<br />
Of all perfection, he that truly loved<br />
Should rather bring a sacrifice of service,<br />
Than raze it with the engines of suspicion:<br />
Of which, when he can wash an &AElig;thiop white,<br />
Leosthenes may hope to free himself;<br />
But, till then, never.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Bold, presumptuous villain!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I will go further, and make good upon him,<br />
I' the pride of all his honours, birth, and fortunes,<br />
He's more unworthy than myself.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Thou liest.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> Confute him with a whip, and, the doubt decided,<br />
Punish him with a halter.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> O the gods!<br />
My ribs, though made of brass, cannot contain<br />
My heart, swollen big with rage. The lie!&mdash;a whip!&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>Let fury then disperse these clouds, in which<br />
I long have march'd disguised; [<i>Throws off his disguise.</i>] that, when they know<br />
Whom they have injured, they may faint with horror<br />
Of my revenge, which, wretched men! expect,<br />
As sure as fate, to suffer.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Ha! Pisander!</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> 'Tis the bold Theban!</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> There's no hope for me then:<br />
I thought I should have put in for a share,<br />
And borne Cleora from them both; but now,<br />
This stranger looks so terrible, that I dare not<br />
So much as look on her.</p>

<p><i>Pisan.</i> Now as myself,<br />
Thy equal at thy best, Leosthenes.<br />
For you, Timagoras, praise heaven you were born<br />
Cleora's brother; 'tis your safest armour.<br />
But I lose time.&mdash;The base lie cast upon me,<br />
I thus return: Thou art a perjured man,<br />
False, and perfidious, and hast made a tender<br />
Of love and service to this lady, when<br />
Thy soul, if thou hast any, can bear witness,<br />
That thou wert not thine own: for proof of this,<br />
Look better on this virgin, and consider,<br />
This Persian shape laid by<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>, and she appearing<br />
In a Greekish dress, such as when first you saw her,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>If she resemble not Pisander's sister,<br />
One call'd Statilia?</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> 'Tis the same! My guilt<br />
So chokes my spirits, I cannot deny<br />
My falsehood, nor excuse it.</p>

<p><i>Pisan.</i> This is she,<br />
To whom thou wert contracted: this the lady,<br />
That, when thou wert my prisoner, fairly taken<br />
In the Spartan war, then, begg'd thy liberty,<br />
And with it gave herself to thee, ungrateful!</p>

<p><i>Statil.</i> No more, sir, I entreat you: I perceive<br />
True sorrow in his looks, and a consent<br />
To make me reparation in mine honour;<br />
And then I am most happy.</p>

<p><i>Pisan.</i> The wrong done her<br />
Drew me from Thebes, with a full intent to kill thee:<br />
But this fair object met me in my fury,<br />
And quite disarm'd me. Being denied to have her,<br />
By you, my lord Archidamus, and not able<br />
To live far from her; love, the mistress of<br />
All quaint devices, prompted me to treat<br />
With a friend of mine, who, as a pirate, sold me<br />
For a slave to you, my lord, and gave my sister,<br />
As a present, to Cleora.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Strange meanders!</p>

<p><i>Pisan.</i> There how I bare myself, needs no relation:<br />
But, if so far descending from the height<br />
Of my then flourishing fortunes, to the lowest<br />
Condition of a man, to have means only<br />
To feed my eye with the sight of what I honour'd;<br />
The dangers too I underwent, the sufferings;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>The clearness of my interest, may deserve<br />
A noble recompense in your lawful favour;<br />
Now 'tis apparent that Leosthenes<br />
Can claim no interest in you, you may please<br />
To think upon my service.</p>

<p><i>Cleo.</i> Sir, my want<br />
Of power to satisfy so great a debt<br />
Makes me accuse my fortune; but if that,<br />
Out of the bounty of your mind, you think<br />
A free surrender of myself full payment,<br />
I gladly tender it.</p>

<p><i>Archid.</i> With my consent too,<br />
All injuries forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Timag.</i> I will study,<br />
In my future service, to deserve your favour,<br />
And good opinion.</p>

<p><i>Leost.</i> Thus I gladly fee<br />
This advocate to plead for me.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Kissing Statilia.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Pisan.</i> You will find me<br />
An easy judge. When I have yielded reasons<br />
Of your bondmen's falling off from their obedience,<br />
Then after, as you please, determine of me.<br />
I found their natures apt to mutiny<br />
From your too cruel usage, and made trial<br />
How far they might be wrought on; to instruct you<br />
To look with more prevention and care<br />
To what they may hereafter undertake<br />
Upon the like occasions. The hurt 's little<br />
They have committed; nor was ever cure,<br />
But with some pain, effected. I confess,<br />
In hope to force a grant of fair Cleora,<br />
I urged them to defend the town against you;<br />
Nor had the terror of your whips, but that<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>I was preparing for defence elsewhere,<br />
So soon got entrance: In this I am guilty;<br />
Now, as you please, your censure.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> Bring them in;<br />
And, though you've given me power, I do entreat<br />
Such as have undergone their insolence,<br />
It may not be offensive, though I study<br />
Pity, more than revenge.</p>

<p><i>Coris.</i> 'Twill best become you.</p>

<p><i>Cleon.</i> I must consent.</p>

<p><i>Asot.</i> For me, I'll find a time<br />
To be revenged hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Timol.</i> And now, the war being ended to our wishes,<br />
And such as went the pilgrimage of love,<br />
Happy in full fruition of their hopes,<br />
'Tis lawful, thanks paid to the Powers divine,<br />
To drown our cares in honest mirth and wine.<br />

<h2><a name="THE_MAID_OF_HONOUR" id="THE_MAID_OF_HONOUR">THE MAID OF HONOUR.</a></h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Maid of Honour.</span>] This tragi-comedy, which
was first printed in 1632, was, as the old title-page informs us,
very frequently acted "at the Ph&oelig;nix in Drury-lane, by the
Queen's Majesty's servants." It was a great favourite, and
with justice, for it has a thousand claims to admiration, and is
of the higher order of Massinger's plays. It will not, indeed,
be very easy to find in any writer a subject more animated, or
characters more variously and pointedly drawn. There is no
delay in introducing the business of the drama; and nothing is
allowed to interfere with its progress. Indeed this is by far
too rapid; and event is precipitated upon event without regard
to time or place. But Massinger acts with a liberty which it
would be absurd to criticise. Thebes and Athens, Palermo and
Sienna, are alike to him; and he must be allowed to transport
his agents and their concerns from one to another, as often as
the exigencies of his ambulatory plan may require.</p>

<p>It is observable, that in this play Massinger has attempted
the more difficult part of dramatic writing. He is not content
with describing different qualities in his characters; but lays
before the reader several differences of the same qualities. The
courage of Gonzaga, though by no means inferior to it, is not
that of Bertoldo. In the former, it is a fixed and habitual
principle, the honourable business of his life. In the latter, it
is an irresistible impulse, the instantaneous result of a fiery
temper. There is still another remove; and these branches of
real courage differ from the poor and forced approaches to
valour in Gasparo and Antonio. A broader distinction is used
with his two courtiers; and the cold interest of Astutio is fully
contrasted with the dazzling and imprudent assumption of
Fulgentio. But Camiola herself is the great object that reigns
throughout the piece. Every where she animates us with her
spirit, and instructs us with her sense. Yet this superiority
takes nothing from her softer feelings. Her tears flow with a
mingled fondness and regret; and she is swayed by a passion
which is only quelled by her greater resolution. The influence
of her character is also heightened through the different manner
of her lovers; through the mad impatience of the uncontrolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Bertoldo, the glittering pretensions of Fulgentio, and the
humble and sincere attachment of Adorni, who nourishes secret
desires of a happiness too exalted for him, faithfully performs
commands prejudicial to his own views, through the force of
an affection which ensures his obedience, and, amidst so much
service, scarcely presumes to hint the passion which consumes
him. I know not if even signior Sylli is wholly useless here;
he serves at least to show her good-humoured toleration of a
being hardly important enough for her contempt.</p>

<p>In the midst of this just praise of Camiola, there are a few
things to be regretted. Reason and religion had forbidden her
union with Bertoldo; and she had declared herself unalterable
in her purpose. His captivity reverses her judgment, and she
determines not only to liberate, but to marry him. Unfortunately
too she demands a sealed contract as the condition of
his freedom; though Bertoldo's ardour was already known to
her, and the generosity of her nature ought to have abstained
from so degrading a bargain. But Massinger wanted to hinder
the marriage of Aurelia; and, with an infelicity which attends
many of his contrivances, he provided a prior contract at the
expense of the delicacy, as well as the principles of his heroine.
It is well, that the nobleness of the conclusion throws the veil
over these blemishes. Her determination is at once natural and
unexpected. It answers to the original independence of her character,
and she retires with our highest admiration and esteem.</p>

<p>It may be observed here, that Massinger was not unknown
to Milton. The date of some of Milton's early poems, indeed,
is not exactly ascertained; but if the reader will compare the
speech of Paulo, with <i>the Penseroso</i>, he cannot fail to remark a
similarity in the cadences, as well as in the measure and the
solemnity of the thoughts. On many other occasions he certainly
remembers Massinger, and frequently in his representations
of female purity, and the commanding dignity of virtue.</p>

<p>A noble lesson arises from the conduct of the principal character.
A fixed sense of truth and rectitude gives genuine
superiority; it corrects the proud, and abashes the vain, and
marks the proper limits between humility and presumption.
It also governs itself with the same ascendancy which it establishes
over others. When the lawful objects of life cannot be
possessed with clearness of honour, it provides a nobler pleasure
in rising above their attraction, and creates a new happiness by
controlling even innocent desires.</p>

<p>That you have been, and continued so for many years,

friendship, (notwithstanding all differences, and suits in law

free confession of a debt, in a meaner man, is the amplest satisfaction

take notice, and from myself, that I had not to this time subsisted,
but that I was supported by your frequent courtesies
and favours. When your more serious occasions will give you
leave, you may please to peruse this trifle, and peradventure
find something in it that may appear worthy of your protection.
Receive it, I beseech you, as a testimony of his duty
who, while he lives, resolves to be</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Good day to your lordship.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> Thanks, Adorni.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> May I presume to ask if the ambassador<br />
Employ'd by Ferdinand, the duke of Urbin,<br />
Hath audience this morning?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fulgentio</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> 'Tis uncertain;<br />
For, though a counsellor of state, I am not<br />
Of the cabinet council: but there's one, if he please,<br />
That may resolve you.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I will move him.&mdash;Sir!</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> If you've a suit, show water<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, I am blind else.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> A suit; yet of a nature not to prove<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>The quarry<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> that you hawk for: if your words<br />
Are not like Indian wares, and every scruple<br />
To be weigh'd and rated, one poor syllable,<br />
Vouchsafed in answer of a fair demand,<br />
Cannot deserve a fee.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> It seems you are ignorant,<br />
I neither speak nor hold my peace for nothing;<br />
And yet, for once, I care not if I answer<br />
One single question, gratis.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I much thank you.<br />
Hath the ambassador audience, sir, to-day?</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> At what hour?</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> I promised not so much.<br />
A syllable you begg'd, my charity gave it;<br />
Move me no further.
<span style="margin-left:9em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> This you wonder at:<br />
With me, 'tis usual.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Pray you, sir, what is he?</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> No gentleman, yet a lord. He hath some drops<br />
Of the king's blood running in his veins, derived<br />
Some ten degrees off. His revenue lies<br />
In a narrow compass, the king's ear; and yields him<br />
Every hour a fruitful harvest. Men may talk<br />
Of three crops in a year in the Fortunate Islands,<br />
Or profit made by wool; but, while there are suitors,<br />
His sheepshearing, nay, shaving to the quick,<br />
Is in every quarter of the moon, and constant.<br />
In the time of trussing a point,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> he can undo,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>Or make a man: his play or recreation,<br />
Is to raise this up, or pull down that; and, though<br />
He never yet took orders, makes more bishops<br />
In Sicily, than the pope himself.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bertoldo, Gasparo, Antonio</span>, <i>and a

Is the king's natural brother.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I understand you.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> With this jewel<br />
Presented to Camiola, prepare,<br />
This night, a visit for me. [<i>Exit Servant.</i>] I shall have<br />
Your company, gallants, I perceive, if that<br />
The king will hear of war.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> You are, sir,<br />
A knight of Malta, and, as I have heard,<br />
Have served against the Turk.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> 'Tis true.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Pray you, show us<br />
The difference between the city valour,<br />
And service in the field.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> 'Tis somewhat more<br />
Than roaring in a tavern or a brothel,<br />

If you bear not yourself both in and upright,<br />
Will slash your scarlets and your plush a new way;<br />
Or, with the hilts, thunder about your ears<br />
Such music as will make your worships dance<br />
To the doleful tune of <i>Lachrym&aelig;</i><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<i>Gasp.</i> I must tell you<br />
In private, as you are my princely friend,<br />
I do not like such fiddlers.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> No! they are useful<br />
For your imitation; I remember you,<br />
When you came first to the court, and talk'd of nothing<br />
But your rents and your entradas<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, ever chiming<br />
The golden bells in your pockets; you believed<br />
The taking of the wall as a tribute due to<br />
Your gaudy clothes; and could not walk at midnight<br />
Without a causeless quarrel, as if men<br />
Of coarser outsides were in duty bound<br />
To suffer your affronts: but, when you had been<br />
Cudgell'd well twice or thrice, and from the doctrine<br />
Made profitable uses, you concluded,<br />
The sovereign means to teach irregular heirs<br />
Civility, with conformity of manners,<br />
Were two or three sound beatings.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> I confess<br />
They did much good upon me.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> And on me:<br />
The principles that they read were sound.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> You'll find<br />
The like instructions in the camp.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> The king!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A flourish. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Roberto, Fulgentio</span>, <i>Ambassador,
and Attendants</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> [<i>ascends the throne.</i>] We sit prepared to hear.</p>

<p><i>Amb.</i> Your majesty<br />
Hath been long since familiar, I doubt not,<br />
With the desperate fortunes of my lord; and pity<br />
Of the much that your confederate hath suffer'd,<br />
You being his last refuge, may persuade you<br />
Not alone to compassionate, but to lend<br />
Your royal aids to stay him in his fall<br />
To certain ruin. He, too late, is conscious<br />
That his ambition to encroach upon<br />
His neighbour's territories, with the danger of<br />
His liberty, nay, his life, hath brought in question<br />
His own inheritance: but youth, and heat<br />
Of blood, in your interpretation, may<br />
Both plead and mediate for him. I must grant it<br />
An error in him, being denied the favours<br />
Of the fair princess of Sienna, (though<br />
He sought her in a noble way,) to endeavour<br />
To force affection by surprisal of<br />
Her principal seat, Sienna.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Which now proves<br />
The seat of his captivity, not triumph:<br />
Heaven is still just.</p>

<p><i>Amb.</i> And yet that justice is<br />
To be with mercy temper'd, which heaven's deputies<br />
Stand bound to minister. The injured duchess,<br />
By reason taught, as nature, could not, with<br />
The reparation of her wrongs, but aim at<br />
A brave revenge; and my lord feels, too late,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>That innocence will find friends. The great Gonzaga,<br />
The honour of his order, (I must praise<br />
Virtue, though in an enemy,) he whose fights<br />
And conquests hold one number, rallying up<br />
Her scatter'd troops, before we could get time<br />
To victual or to man the conquer'd city,<br />
Sat down before it; and presuming that<br />
'Tis not to be relieved, admits no parley,<br />
Our flags of truce hung out in vain: nor will he<br />
Lend an ear to composition, but exacts,<br />
With the rendering up the town, the goods and lives<br />
Of all within the walls, and of all sexes,<br />
To be at his discretion.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Since injustice<br />
In your duke meets this correction, can you press us,<br />
With any seeming argument of reason,<br />
In foolish pity to decline<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> his dangers,<br />
To draw them on ourself? Shall we not be<br />
Warn'd by his harms? The league proclaim'd between us<br />
Bound neither of us further than to aid<br />
Each other, if by foreign force invaded;<br />
And so far in my honour I was tied.<br />
But since, without our counsel, or allowance,<br />
He hath ta'en arms; with his good leave, he must<br />
Excuse us if we steer not on a rock<br />
We see, and may avoid. Let other monarchs<br />
Contend to be made glorious by proud war,<br />
And, with the blood of their poor subjects, purchase<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>Increase of empire, and augment their cares<br />
In keeping that which was by wrongs extorted,<br />
Gilding unjust invasions with the trim<br />
Of glorious conquests; we, that would be known<br />
The father of our people, in our study<br />
And vigilance for their safety, must not change<br />
Their ploughshares into swords, and force them from<br />
The secure shade of their own vines, to be<br />
Scorch'd with the flames of war; or, for our sport,<br />
Expose their lives to ruin.</p>

<p><i>Amb.</i> Will you, then,<br />
In his extremity, forsake your friend?</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> No; but preserve ourself.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Cannot the beams<br />
Of honour thaw your icy fears?</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Who's that?</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> A kind of brother, sir, howe'er your subject;<br />
Your father's son, and one who blushes that<br />
You are not heir to his brave spirit and vigour,<br />
As to his kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> How's this!</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Sir, to be<br />
His living chronicle, and to speak his praise,<br />
Cannot deserve your anger.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Where's your warrant<br />
For this presumption?</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Here, sir, in my heart:<br />
Let sycophants, that feed upon your favours,<br />
Style coldness in you caution, and prefer<br />
Your ease before your honour; and conclude,<br />
To eat and sleep supinely is the end<br />
Of human blessings: I must tell you, sir,<br />
Virtue, if not in action, is a vice;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>And when we move not forward, we go backward<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>:<br />
Nor is this peace, the nurse of drones and cowards,<br />
Our health, but a disease.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Well urged, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Perfect what is so well begun.</p>

<p><i>Amb.</i> And bind<br />
My lord your servant.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Hair-brain'd fool! what reason<br />
Canst thou infer, to make this good?</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> A thousand,<br />
Not to be contradicted. But consider<br />
Where your command lies: 'tis not, sir, in France,<br />
Spain, Germany, Portugal, but in Sicily;<br />
An island, sir. Here are no mines of gold<br />
Or silver to enrich you; no worm spins<br />
Silk in her womb, to make distinction<br />
Between you and a peasant, in your habits;<br />
No fish lives near our shores, whose blood can dye<br />
Scarlet or purple; all that we possess,<br />
With beasts we have in common: nature did<br />
Design us to be warriors, and to break through<br />
Our ring, the sea, by which we are environ'd;<br />
And we by force must fetch in what is wanting,<br />
Or precious to us. Add to this, we are<br />
A populous nation, and increase so fast,<br />
That, if we by our providence are not sent<br />
Abroad in colonies, or fall by the sword,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>Not Sicily, though now it were more fruitful<br />
Than when 't was styled the granary of great Rome,<br />
Can yield our numerous fry bread: we must starve,<br />
Or eat up one another.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> The king hears<br />
With much attention.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> And seems moved with what<br />
Bertoldo hath deliver'd.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> May you live long, sir,<br />
The king of peace, so you deny not us<br />
The glory of the war; let not our nerves<br />
Shrink up with sloth, nor, for want of employment,<br />
Make younger brothers thieves: it is their swords, sir,<br />
Must sow and reap their harvest. If examples<br />
May move you more than arguments, look on England,<br />
The empress of the European isles,<br />
And unto whom alone ours yields precedence:<br />
When did she flourish so, as when she was<br />
The mistress of the ocean, her navies<br />
Putting a girdle round about the world?<br />
When the Iberian quaked, her worthies named;<br />
And the fair flower-de-luce grew pale, set by<br />
The red rose and the white? Let not our armour<br />
Hung up, or our unrigg'd armada, make us<br />
Ridiculous to the late poor snakes our neighbours,<br />
Warm'd in our bosoms, and to whom again<br />
We may be terrible. Rouse us, sir, from the sleep<br />
Of idleness, and redeem our mortgaged honours.<br />
Your birth, and justly, claims my father's kingdom;<br />
But his heroic mind descends to me:<br />
I will confirm so much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
<i>Ador.</i> In his looks he seems<br />
To break ope Janus' temple.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> How these younglings<br />
Take fire from him!</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> It works an alteration<br />
Upon the king.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> I can forbear no longer:<br />
War, war, my sovereign!</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> The king appears<br />
Resolved, and does prepare to speak.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Think not<br />
Our counsel 's built upon so weak a base,<br />
As to be overturn'd, or shaken, with<br />
Tempestuous winds of words. As I, my lord,<br />
Before resolved you, I will not engage<br />
My person in this quarrel; neither press<br />
My subjects to maintain it: yet, to show<br />
My rule is gentle, and that I have feeling<br />
O' your master's sufferings, since these gallants, weary<br />
Of the happiness of peace, desire to taste<br />
The bitter sweets of war, we do consent<br />
That, as adventurers and volunteers,<br />
No way compell'd by us, they may make trial<br />
Of their boasted valours.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> We desire no more.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> 'Tis well; and, but my grant in this, expect not<br />
Assistance from me. Govern, as you please,<br />
The province you make choice of; for, I vow<br />
By all things sacred, if that thou miscarry<br />
In this rash undertaking, I will hear it<br />
No otherwise than as a sad disaster,<br />
Fallen on a stranger; nor will I esteem<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>That man my subject, who, in thy extremes,<br />
In purse or person aids thee. Take your fortune:<br />
You know me; I have said it. So, my lord,<br />
You have my absolute answer.</p>

<p><i>Amb.</i> My prince pays,<br />
In me, his duty.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Follow me, Fulgentio,<br />
And you, Astutio.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Flourish. Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Roberto, Fulgentio, Astutio</span>, <i>and Attendants</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> What a frown he threw,<br />
At his departure, on you!</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Let him keep<br />
His smiles for his state flatterer, I care not.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Shall we aboard to night?</p>

<p><i>Amb.</i> Your speed, my lord,<br />
Doubles the benefit.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> I have a business<br />
Requires despatch; some two hours hence I'll meet you.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>


<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Signior</i> <span class="smcap">Sylli</span>, <i>walking fantastically, followed
by</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Nay, signior, this is too much ceremony,<br />
In my own house.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> What's gracious abroad,<br />
Must be in private practised.</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> For your mirth's sake<br />
Let him alone; he has been all this morning<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>In practice with a peruked gentleman-usher,<br />
To teach him his true amble, and his postures,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">[<span class="smcap">Sylli</span> <i>walking by, and practising</i>.</span><br />
When he walks before a lady.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> You may, madam,<br />
Perhaps, believe that I in this use art,<br />
To make you dote upon me, by exposing<br />
My more than most rare features to your view:<br />
But I, as I have ever done, deal simply.<br />
Look not with too much contemplation on me;<br />
If you do, you are lost.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Is 't possible?<br />
What philters or love-powders do you use,<br />
To force affection? I see nothing in<br />
Your person but I dare look on, yet keep<br />
My own poor heart still.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> You are warn'd&mdash;be arm'd;<br />
And do not lose the hope of such a husband,<br />
In being too soon enamour'd.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Never fear it;<br />
Though your best taking part, your wealth, were trebled,<br />
I would not woo you. But since in your pity<br />
You please to give me caution, tell me what<br />
Temptations I must fly from.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> The first is,<br />
That you never hear me sing, for I'm a Syren:<br />
If you observe, when I warble, the dogs howl,<br />
As ravish'd with my ditties; and you will<br />
Run mad to hear me.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I will stop my ears,<br />
And keep my little wits.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Next, when I dance,<br />
And come aloft thus, [<i>capers</i>] cast not a sheep's eye<br />
Upon the quivering of my calf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
<i>Cam.</i> Proceed, sir.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Nor should your little ladyship be taken with<br />
My pretty spider-fingers, nor my eyes,<br />
That twinkle on both sides.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Was there ever such<br />
A piece of motley<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> heard of! [<i>A knocking within.</i>] Who's that? [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda.</span>] You may spare<br />
The catalogue of my dangers.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> No, good madam;<br />
I have not told you half.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Enough, good signior.&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>.</p>

<p>Who is 't?</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> The brother of the king.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Nay, start not.<br />
The brother of the king! is he no more?<br />
Were it the king himself, I'd give him leave<br />
To speak his mind to you, for I am not jealous;<br />
And, to assure your ladyship of so much,<br />
I'll usher him in, and, that done&mdash;hide myself,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Aside, and exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Camiola, if ever, now be constant:<br />
This is, indeed, a suitor, whose sweet presence,<br />
Courtship, and loving language, would have stagger'd<br />
The chaste Penelope; and, to increase<br />
The wonder, did not modesty forbid it,<br />
I should ask that from him he sues to me for:<br />
And yet my reason, like a tyrant, tells me<br />
I must nor give nor take it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sylli</span> <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Bertoldo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I must tell you,<br />
You lose your labour. Yet you shall have my countenance<br />
To parley with her, and I'll take special care<br />
That none shall interrupt you.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> You are courteous.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Come, wench, wilt thou hear wisdom?</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> Yes, from you, sir.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>They walk aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> If forcing this sweet favour from your hand,
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Kisses her hand.</i></span><br />
Fair madam, argue me of too much boldness,<br />
When you are pleased to understand I take<br />
A parting kiss, if not excuse, at least<br />
'Twill qualify the offence.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> A parting kiss, sir!<br />
What nation, envious of the happiness<br />
Which Sicily enjoys in your sweet presence,<br />
Can buy you from her? or what climate yield<br />
Pleasures transcending those which you enjoy here,<br />
Being both beloved and honour'd; the north-star<br />
And guider of all hearts; and, to sum up<br />
Your full account of happiness in a word,<br />
The brother of the king?</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Do you, alone,<br />
And with an unexampled cruelty,<br />
Enforce my absence, and deprive me of<br />
Those blessings which you, with a polish'd phrase,<br />
Seem to insinuate that I do possess,<br />
And yet tax me as being guilty of<br />
My wilful exile? What are titles to me,<br />
Or popular suffrage, or my nearness to<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>The king in blood, or fruitful Sicily,<br />
Though it confess'd no sovereign but myself,<br />
When you, that are the essence of my being,<br />
The anchor of my hopes, the real substance<br />
Of my felicity, in your disdain,<br />
Turn all to fading and deceiving shadows?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You tax me without cause.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> You must confess it.<br />
But answer love with love, and seal the contract<br />
In the uniting of our souls, how gladly<br />
(Though now I were in action, and assured,<br />
Following my fortune, that plumed Victory<br />
Would make her glorious stand upon my tent)<br />
Would I put off my armour, in my heat<br />
Of conquest, and, like Antony, pursue<br />
My Cleopatra! Will you yet look on me<br />
With an eye of favour?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Truth bear witness for me,<br />
That, in the judgment of my soul, you are<br />
A man so absolute, and circular,<br />
In all those wish'd-for rarities that may take<br />
A virgin captive, that, though at this instant<br />
All scepter'd monarchs of our western world<br />
Were rivals with you, and Camiola worthy<br />
Of such a competition, you alone<br />
Should wear the garland.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> If so, what diverts<br />
Your favour from me?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> No mulct in yourself,<br />
Or in your person, mind, or fortune.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> What then?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> The consciousness of mine own wants: alas! sir,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>We are not parallels; but, like lines divided,<br />
Can ne'er meet in one centre<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. Your birth, sir,<br />
Without addition, were an ample dowry<br />
For one of fairer fortunes; and this shape,<br />
Were you ignoble, far above all value:<br />
To this so clear a mind, so furnish'd with<br />
Harmonious faculties moulded from heaven,<br />
That though you were Thersites in your features,<br />
Of no descent, and Irus in your fortunes,<br />
Ulysses-like, you'd force all eyes and ears<br />
To love, but seen; and, when heard, wonder at<br />
Your matchless story: but all these bound up<br />
Together in one volume!&mdash;give me leave<br />
With admiration to look upon them;<br />
But not presume, in my own flattering hopes,<br />
I may or can enjoy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span><i>Bert.</i> How you ruin<br />
What you would seem to build up! I know no<br />
Disparity between us: you're an heir,<br />
Sprung from a noble family; fair, rich, young,<br />
And every way my equal.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Sir, excuse me;<br />
One aerie with proportion ne'er discloses<br />
The eagle and the wren<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>:&mdash;tissue and frieze<br />
In the same garment, monstrous! But suppose<br />
That what 's in you excessive were diminish'd,<br />
And my desert supplied; the stronger bar,<br />
Religion, stops our entrance: you are, sir,<br />
A knight of Malta, by your order bound<br />
To a single life; you cannot marry me;<br />
And, I assure myself, you are too noble<br />
To seek me, though my frailty should consent,<br />
In a base path.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> A dispensation, lady,<br />
Will easily absolve me.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> O take heed, sir!<br />
When what is vow'd to heaven is dispensed with,<br />
To serve our ends on earth, a curse must follow,<br />
And not a blessing.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Is there no hope left me?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Nor to myself, but is a neighbour to<br />
Impossibility. True love should walk<br />
On equal feet; in us it does not, sir:<br />
But rest assured, excepting this, I shall be<br />
Devoted to your service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
<i>Bert.</i> And this is your<br />
Determinate sentence?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Not to be revoked.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Farewell, then, fairest cruel! all thoughts in me<br />
Of women perish. Let the glorious light<br />
Of noble war extinguish Love's dim taper.<br />
That only lends me light to see my folly:<br />
Honour, be thou my ever-living mistress,<br />
And fond affection, as thy bond-slave, serve thee!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> How soon my sun is set, he being absent,<br />
Never to rise again! What a fierce battle<br />
Is fought between my passions!</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I perceive<br />
He has his answer: now must I step in<br />
To comfort her. [Comes forward.] You have found, I hope, sweet lady,<br />
Some difference between a youth of my pitch,<br />
And this bugbear Bertoldo. Despair not; I<br />
May be in time entreated.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Be so now, to leave me.&mdash;<br />
Lights for my chamber! O my heart!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>


<h3>ACT II. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Room in the Palace.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Roberto, Fulgentio</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Astutio</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Embark'd to-night, do you say?</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> I saw him aboard, sir.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> And without taking of his leave?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
<i>Ast.</i> 'Twas strange!</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Are we grown so contemptible?</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> 'Tis far<br />
From me, sir, to add fuel to your anger,<br />
That, in your ill opinion of him, burns<br />
Too hot already; else, I should affirm<br />
It was a gross neglect.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> A wilful scorn<br />
Of duty and allegiance; you give it<br />
Too fair a name: but we shall think on 't. Can you<br />
Guess what the numbers were, that follow'd him<br />
In his desperate action?</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> More than you think, sir.<br />
All ill-affected spirits in Palermo,<br />
Or to your government or person, with<br />
The turbulent swordmen, such whose poverty forced them<br />
To wish a change, are gone along with him;<br />
Creatures devoted to his undertakings,<br />
In right or wrong: and, to express their zeal<br />
And readiness to serve him, ere they went,<br />
Profanely took the sacrament on their knees,<br />
To live and die with him.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> O most impious!<br />
Their loyalty to us forgot?</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> I fear so.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> Unthankful as they are!</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Yet this deserves not<br />
One troubled thought in you, sir; with your pardon,<br />
I hold that their remove from hence makes more<br />
For your security than danger.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> True;<br />
And, as I'll fashion it, they shall feel it too.<br />
Astutio, you shall presently be despatch'd<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>With letters, writ and sign'd with our own hand,<br />
To the duchess of Sienna, in excuse<br />
Of our part in these forces sent against her.<br />
You must, beside, from us take some instructions,<br />
To be imparted, as you judge them useful,<br />
To the general Gonzaga. Instantly<br />
Prepare you for your journey.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> With the wings<br />
Of loyalty and duty.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> I am bold<br />

To honour her with a visit.</p>

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni, Sylli</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> So melancholy, say you!</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> Never given<br />
To such retirement.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Can you guess the cause?</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> If it hath not its birth and being from<br />
The brave Bertoldo's absence, I confess<br />
'Tis past my apprehension.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> You are wide,<br />
The whole field wide<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. I, in my understanding,<br />
Pity your ignorance.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Resolve us.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Know,<br />
Here walks the cause. She dares not look upon me;<br />
My beauties are so terrible and enchanting,<br />
She cannot endure my sight.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> There I believe you.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> But the time will come, be comforted, when I will<br />
Put off this vizor of unkindness to her,<br />
And show an amorous and yielding face:<br />
And, until then, though Hercules himself<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>Desire to see her, he had better eat<br />
His club, than pass her threshold; for I will be<br />
Her Cerberus, to guard her.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> A good dog!</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> Worth twenty porters.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Page.</i></p>

<p><i>Page.</i> Keep you open house here?<br />
No groom to attend a gentleman! O, I spy one.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> He means not me, I am sure.</p>

<p><i>Page.</i> You, sirrah sheep's-head,<br />
With a face cut on a cat-stick<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>, do you hear?<br />
You, yeoman fewterer<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>, conduct me to<br />
The lady of the mansion, or my poniard<br />
Shall disembogue thy soul.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> O terrible! <i>disembogue!</i><br />
I talk'd of Hercules, and here is one<br />
Bound up in <i>decimo sexto</i>.</p>

<p><i>Page.</i> Answer, wretch.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Pray you, little gentleman, be not so furious:<br />
The lady keeps her chamber.</p>

<p><i>Page.</i> And we present,<br />
Sent on an embassy to her! but here is<br />
Her gentlewoman. Sirrah! hold my cloak,<br />
While I take a leap at her lips: do it, and neatly;<br />
Or, having first tripp'd up thy heels, I'll make<br />
Thy back my footstool.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Kisses</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
<i>Syl.</i> Tamberlane in little!<br />
Am I turn'd Turk<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>! What an office am I put to!</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> My lady, gentle youth, is indisposed.</p>

<p><i>Page.</i> Though she were dead and buried, only tell her,<br />
The great man in the court, the brave Fulgentio,<br />
Descends to visit her, and it will raise her<br />
Out of the grave for joy.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fulgentio</span>.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Here comes another!<br />
The devil, I fear, in his holiday clothes.</p>

<p><i>Page.</i> So soon!<br />
My part is at an end then. Cover my shoulders;<br />
When I grow great, thou shalt serve me.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Are you, sirrah,<br />
An implement of the house?
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sylli.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Sure he will make<br />
A jointstool of me!</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Or, if you belong
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ador.</span></span><br />
To the lady of the place, command her hither.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I do not wear her livery, yet acknowledge<br />
A duty to her; and as little bound<br />
To serve your peremptory will, as she is<br />
To obey your summons. 'Twill become you, sir,<br />
To wait her leisure; then, her pleasure known,<br />
You may present your duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
<i>Ful.</i> Duty! Slave,<br />
I'll teach you manners.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I'm past learning; make not<br />
A tumult in the house.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Shall I be braved thus?
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>They draw.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> Help! murder!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> What insolence is this? Adorni, hold,<br />
Hold, I command you.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Saucy groom!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Not so, sir;<br />
However, in his life, he had dependence<br />
Upon my father, he's a gentleman,<br />
As well born as yourself. Put on your hat.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> In my presence, without leave!</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> He has mine, madam.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> And I must tell you, sir, and in plain language,<br />
Howe'er your glittering outside promise gentry,<br />
The rudeness of your carriage and behaviour<br />
Speaks you a coarser thing.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> She means a clown, sir;<br />
I am her interpreter, for want of a better.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I am a queen in mine own house; nor must you<br />
Expect an empire here.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Sure I must love her<br />
Before the day, the pretty soul's so valiant.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> What are you? and what would you with me?</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Proud one,<br />
When you know what I am, and what I came for,<br />
And may, on your submission, proceed to,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>You, in your reason, must repent the coarseness<br />
Of my entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Why, fine man? what are you?</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> A kinsman of the king's.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I cry you mercy,<br />
For his sake, not your own. But, grant you are so,<br />
'Tis not impossible but a king may have<br />
A fool to his kinsman,&mdash;no way meaning you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> You have heard of Fulgentio?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Long since, sir;<br />
A suit-broker in court. He has the worst<br />
Report among good men I ever heard of,<br />
For bribery and extortion: in their prayers,<br />
Widows and orphans curse him for a canker<br />
And caterpillar in the state. I hope,<br />
Sir, you are not the man.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> I reply not<br />
As you deserve, being assured you know me;<br />
Pretending ignorance of my person, only<br />
To give me a taste of your wit: 'tis well, and courtly;<br />
I like a sharp wit well.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I cannot endure it;<br />
Nor any of the Syllis.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> More; I know, too,<br />
This harsh induction must serve as a foil<br />
To the well-tuned observance and respect<br />
You will hereafter pay me, being made<br />
Familiar with my credit with the king,<br />
And that (contain your joy) I deign to love you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Love me! I am not rapt with it.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Hear 't again;<br />
I love you honestly: now you admire me.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I do, indeed; it being a word so seldom<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>Heard from a courtier's mouth. But, pray you, deal plainly,<br />
Since you find me simple; what might be the motives<br />
Inducing you to leave the freedom of<br />
A bachelor's life, on your soft neck to wear<br />
The stubborn yoke of marriage; and, of all<br />
The beauties in Palermo, to choose me,<br />
Poor me? that is the main point you must treat of.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Why, I will tell you. Of a little thing<br />
You are a pretty peat<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>, indifferent fair too;<br />
And, like a new-rigg'd ship, both tight and yare:<br />
Besides, the quickness of your eye assures<br />
An active spirit.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You are pleasant, sir;<br />
Yet I presume that there was one thing in me,<br />
Unmention'd yet, that took you more than all<br />
Those parts you have remember'd.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> My wealth, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> You are in the right; without that, beauty is<br />
A flower worn in the morning, at night trod on:<br />
But beauty, youth, and fortune meeting in you,<br />
I will vouchsafe to marry you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You speak well;<br />
And, in return, excuse me, sir, if I<br />
Deliver reasons why, upon no terms,<br />
I'll marry you: I fable not.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I am glad<br />
To hear this: I began to have an ague.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Come, your wise reasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
<i>Cam.</i> Such as they are, pray take them:<br />
First, I am doubtful whether you are a man,<br />
Since, for your shape, trimm'd up in a lady's dressing,<br />
You might pass for a woman; for the fairness<br />
Of your complexion, which you think will take me,<br />
The colour, I must tell you, in a man,<br />
Is weak and faint, and never will hold out,<br />
If put to labour: give me the lovely brown,<br />
A thick curl'd hair of the same die, a leg without<br />
An artificial calf;&mdash;I suspect yours;<br />
But let that pass.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> She means me all this while,<br />
For I have every one of those good parts;<br />
O Sylli! fortunate Sylli!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You are moved, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Fie! no; go on.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Then, as you are a courtier,<br />
A graced one too, I fear you have been too forward;<br />
And so much for your person. One word more,<br />
And I have done.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> I'll ease you of the trouble,<br />
Coy and disdainful!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Save me, or else he'll beat me.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> No, your own folly shall; and, since you put me<br />
To my last charm, look upon this, and tremble.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Shows the king's ring.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> At the sight of a fair ring! the king's, I take it?<br />
I have seen him wear the like: if he hath sent it,<br />
As a favour, to me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Yes, 'tis very likely,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>His dying mother's gift, prized as his crown!<br />
By this he does command you to be mine;<br />
By his gift you are so:&mdash;you may yet redeem all.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You are in a wrong account still. Though the king may<br />
Dispose of my life and goods, my mind's mine own,<br />
And never shall be yours. The king, heaven bless him!<br />
Is good and gracious, and will not compel<br />
His subjects against their wills. I believe,<br />
Forgetting it when he wash'd his hands, you stole it,<br />
With an intent to awe me. But you are cozen'd;<br />
I am still myself, and will be.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> A proud haggard<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>,<br />
And not to be reclaim'd! which of your grooms,<br />
Your coachman, fool, or footman, is the lover<br />
Preferr'd before me?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You are foul-mouth'd.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Much fairer<br />
Than thy black soul; and so I will proclaim thee.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Were I a man, thou durst not speak this.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> Heaven<br />
So prosper me, as I resolve to do it<br />
To all men, and in every place: scorn'd by<br />
A tit of ten-pence!
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exeunt</i></span> <span class="smcap">Fulgentio</span> <i>and Page</i>.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Now I begin to be valiant:<br />
Nay, I will draw my sword. O for a brother<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>Do a friend's part; pray you, carry him the length of 't.<br />
I give him three years and a day to match my Toledo,<br />
And then we'll fight like dragons.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Pray, have patience.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I may live to have vengeance: my Bertoldo<br />
Would not have heard this.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Madam,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Pray you, spare<br />
Your language. Prithee fool<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, and make me merry.

<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Siennese. A Camp before the Walls of Sienna.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Chambers shot off: a Flourish as to an Assault:
after which, enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gonzaga, Pierio, Roderigo,
Jacomo</span>, <i>and Soldiers</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Is the breach made assaultable?</p>

<p><i>Pier.</i> Yes, and the moat<br />
Fill'd up; the cannoneer hath done his parts;<br />
We may enter six abreast.</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> There's not a man<br />
Dares show himself upon the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
<i>Jac.</i> Defeat not<br />
The soldiers' hoped-for spoil.</p>

<p><i>Pier.</i> If you, sir,<br />
Delay the assault, and the city be given up<br />
To your discretion, you in honour cannot<br />
Use the extremity of war,&mdash;but, in<br />
Compassion to them, you to us prove cruel.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> And an enemy to yourself.</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> A hindrance to<br />
The brave revenge you have vow'd.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Temper your heat,<br />
And lose not, by too sudden rashness, that<br />
Which, be but patient, will be offer'd to you.<br />
Security ushers ruin; proud contempt<br />
Of an enemy three parts vanquish'd, with desire<br />
And greediness of spoil, have often wrested<br />
A certain victory from the conqueror's gripe.<br />
Discretion is the tutor of the war.<br />
Valour the pupil; and, when we command<br />
With lenity, and our direction's follow'd<br />
With cheerfulness, a prosperous end must crown<br />
Our works well undertaken.</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> Ours are finish'd&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pier.</i> If we make use of fortune.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Her false smiles<br />
Deprive you of your judgments. The condition<br />
Of our affairs exacts a double care,<br />
And, like bifronted Janus, we must look<br />
Backward, as forward: though a flattering calm<br />
Bids us urge on, a sudden tempest raised,<br />
Not feared, much less expected, in our rear,<br />
May foully fall upon us, and distract us<br />
To our confusion.&mdash;

<p class="center"><i>Enter a Scout, hastily.</i></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Our scout! what brings</span><br />
Thy ghastly looks, and sudden speed?</p>

<p><i>Scout.</i> The assurance<br />
Of a new enemy.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> This I foresaw and fear'd.<br />
What are they, know'st thou?</p>

<p><i>Scout.</i> They are, by their colours,<br />
Sicilians, bravely mounted, and the brightness<br />
Of their rich armours doubly gilded with<br />
Reflection of the sun.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> From Sicily?&mdash;&mdash;<br />
The king in league! no war proclaim'd! 'tis foul:<br />
But this must be prevented, not disputed.<br />
Ha! how is this? your estridge<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> plumes, that but<br />
Even now, like quills of porcupines, seem'd to threaten<br />
The stars, drop at the rumour of a shower,<br />
And, like to captive colours, sweep the earth!<br />
Bear up; but in great dangers, greater minds<br />
Are never proud. Shall a few loose troops, untrain'd<br />
But in a customary ostentation,<br />
Presented as a sacrifice to your valours,<br />
Cause a dejection in you?</p>

<p><i>Pier.</i> No dejection.</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> However startled, where you lead we'll follow.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> 'Tis bravely said. We will not stay their charge,<br />
But meet them man to man, and horse to horse.<br />
Pierio, in our absence hold our place;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>And with our foot men and those sickly troops<br />
Prevent a sally: I in mine own person,<br />
With part of the cavallery, will bid<br />
These hunters welcome to a bloody breakfast:&mdash;<br />
But I lose time.</p>

<p><i>Pier.</i> I'll to my charge.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> And we<br />

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ferdinand, Druso</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Livio</span>, <i>on the Walls</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> No aids from Sicily! Hath hope forsook us;<br />
And that vain comfort to affliction, pity,<br />
By our vow'd friend denied us? we can nor live<br />
Nor die with honour: like beasts in a toil,<br />
We wait the leisure of the bloody hunter,<br />
Who is not so far reconciled unto us,<br />
As in one death to give a period<br />
To our calamities; but in delaying<br />
The fate we cannot fly from, starved with wants,<br />
We die this night, to live again to-morrow,<br />
And suffer greater torments.</p>

<p><i>Dru.</i> There is not<br />
Three days' provision for every soldier,<br />
At an ounce of bread a day, left in the city.</p>

<p><i>Liv.</i> To die the beggar's death, with hunger made<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>Anatomies while we live, cannot but crack<br />
Our heart-strings with vexation.</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> Would they would break,<br />
Break altogether! How willingly, like Cato,<br />
Could I tear out my bowels, rather than<br />
Look on the conqueror's insulting face;<br />
But that religion, and the horrid dream<br />
To be suffer'd in the other world, denies it!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a Soldier.</i></p>

<p>What news with thee?</p>

<p><i>Sold.</i> From the turret of the fort,<br />
By the rising clouds of dust, through which, like lightning,<br />
The splendour of bright arms sometimes brake through,<br />
I did descry some forces making towards us;<br />
And, from the camp, as emulous of their glory,<br />
The general, (for I know him by his horse,)<br />
And bravely seconded, encounter'd them.<br />
Their greetings were too rough for friends; their swords,<br />
And not their tongues, exchanging courtesies.<br />
By this the main battalias are join'd;<br />
And, if you please to be spectators of<br />
The horrid issue, I will bring you where,<br />
As in a theatre, you may see their fates<br />
In purple gore presented.</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> Heaven, if yet thou art<br />
Appeased for my wrong done to Aurelia,<br />
Take pity of my miseries! Lead the way, friend.<br />

<h3>SCENE V.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Plain near the Camp.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>A long Charge; after which, a Flourish for Victory:

<p><i>Gonz.</i> We have them yet, though they cost us dear. This was<br />
Charged home, and bravely follow'd. Be to yourselves
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Jacomo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Roderigo</span>.</span><br />
True mirrors to each other's worth; and, looking<br />

<span style="margin-left: 13em;">[Points to <span class="smcap">Bert</span>.</span><br />
The glorious livery of triumphant war,<br />
Imagine these with equal grace appear<br />
Upon yourselves. The bloody sweat you have suffer'd<br />
In this laborious, nay, toilsome harvest,<br />
Yields a rich crop of conquest; and the spoil,<br />
Most precious balsam to a soldier's hurts,<br />
Will ease and cure them. Let me look upon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<span class="smcap">Gasparo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span> <i>are brought forward</i>.</span><br />
The prisoners' faces. Oh, how much transform'd<br />
From what they were! O Mars! were these toys fashion'd<br />
To undergo the burthen of thy service?<br />
The weight of their defensive armour bruised<br />
Their weak effeminate limbs, and would have forced them,<br />
In a hot day, without a blow to yield.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> This insultation shows not manly in you.</p>

Seduced you to exchange your ease in court<br />
For labour in the field? Perhaps you thought<br />
To charge, through dust and blood, an armed foe,<br />
Was but like graceful running at the ring<br />
For a wanton mistress' glove; and the encounter,<br />
A soft impression on her lips:&mdash;but you<br />
Are gaudy butterflies, and I wrong myself<br />
In parling with you.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> <i>V&oelig; victis!</i> now we prove it.</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> But here's one fashion'd in another mould,<br />
And made of tougher metal.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> True; I owe him<br />
For this wound bravely given.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> O that mountains<br />
Were heap'd upon me, that I might expire,<br />
A wretch no more remember'd!
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Look up, sir;<br />
To be o'ercome deserves no shame. If you<br />
Had fallen ingloriously, or could accuse<br />
Your want of courage in resistance, 'twere<br />
To be lamented: but, since you perform'd<br />
As much as could be hoped for from a man,<br />
(Fortune his enemy,) you wrong yourself<br />
In this dejection. I am honour'd in<br />
My victory over you; but to have these<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>My prisoners, is, in my true judgment, rather<br />
Captivity than a triumph: you shall find<br />
Fair quarter from me, and your many wounds,<br />
Which I hope are not mortal, with such care<br />
Look'd to and cured, as if your nearest friend<br />
Attended on you.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> When you know me better,<br />
You will make void this promise: can you call me<br />
Into your memory?</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> The brave Bertoldo!<br />
A brother of our order! By St. John,<br />
Our holy patron, I am more amazed,<br />
Nay, thunderstruck with thy apostacy,<br />
And precipice from the most solemn vows<br />
Made unto Heaven when this, the glorious badge<br />
Of our Redeemer, was conferred upon thee<br />
By the great master, than if I had seen<br />
A reprobate Jew, an atheist, Turk, or Tartar,<br />
Baptized in our religion!</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> This I look'd for;<br />
And am resolved to suffer.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Fellow-soldiers,<br />
Behold this man, and, taught by his example,<br />
Know that 'tis safer far to play with lightning,<br />
Than trifle in things sacred. In my rage
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Weeps.</i></span><br />
I shed these at the funeral of his virtue,<br />
Faith, and religion; why, I will tell you:&mdash;<br />
He was a gentleman so train'd up and fashion'd<br />
For noble uses, and his youth did promise<br />
Such certainties, more than hopes, of great achievements,<br />
As&mdash;if the Christian world had stood opposed<br />
Against the Othoman race, to try the fortune<br />
Of one encounter&mdash;this Bertoldo had been,<br />
For his knowledge to direct, and matchless courage<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>To execute, without a rival, by<br />
The votes of good men, chosen general;<br />
As the prime soldier, and most deserving<br />
Of all that wear the cross: which now, in justice,<br />
I thus tear from him.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Let me die with it<br />
Upon my breast.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> No; by this thou wert sworn,<br />
On all occasions, as a knight, to guard<br />
Weak ladies from oppression, and never<br />
To draw thy sword against them; whereas thou,<br />
In hope of gain or glory, when a princess,<br />
And such a princess as Aurelia is,<br />
Was dispossess'd by violence of what was<br />
Her true inheritance, against thine oath<br />
Hast, to thy uttermost, labour'd to uphold<br />
Her falling enemy. But thou shalt pay<br />
A heavy forfeiture, and learn too late,<br />
Valour employ'd in an ill quarrel turns<br />
To cowardice, and Virtue then puts on<br />
Foul Vice's visor. This is that which cancels<br />
All friendship's bands between us.&mdash;Bear them off;<br />
I will hear no reply: and let the ransom<br />
Of these, for they are yours, be highly rated.<br />
In this I do but right, and let it be<br />
Styled justice, and not wilful cruelty.

<h3>ACT III. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Camp before the Walls of Sienna.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gonzaga, Astutio, Roderigo</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jacomo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> What I have done, sir, by the law of arms<br />
I can and will make good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
<i>Ast.</i> I have no commission<br />
To expostulate the act. These letters speak<br />
The king my master's love to you, and his<br />
Vow'd service to the duchess, on whose person<br />
I am to give attendance.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> At this instant,<br />
She's at Fienza: you may spare the trouble<br />
Of riding thither: I have advertised her<br />
Of our success, and on what humble terms<br />
Sienna stands: though presently I can<br />
Possess it, I defer it, that she may<br />
Enter her own, and, as she please, dispose of<br />
The prisoners and the spoil.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> I thank you, sir.<br />
In the mean time, if I may have your licence,<br />
I have a nephew, and one once my ward,<br />
For whose liberties and ransoms I would gladly<br />
Make composition.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> They are, as I take it,<br />
Call'd Gasparo and Antonio.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> The same, sir.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> For them, you must treat with these; but, for Bertoldo,<br />
He is mine own: if the king will ransom him,<br />
He pays down fifty thousand crowns; if not,<br />
He lives and dies my slave.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> Pray you, a word:
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Gonz.</span></span><br />
The king will rather thank you to detain him,<br />
Than give one crown to free him.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> At his pleasure.<br />
I'll send the prisoners under guard: my business<br />
Calls me another way.
<span style="margin-left:8em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> My service waits you.<br />
Now, gentlemen, for this ransom, since you are not<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>To be brought lower, there is no evading;<br />
I'll be your paymaster.</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> We desire no better.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> But not a word of what's agreed between us,<br />
Till I have school'd my gallants.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> I am dumb, sir.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a Guard, with</i> <span class="smcap">Bertoldo, Antonio</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Gasparo</span>, <i>in irons</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> And where removed now? hath the tyrant found out<br />
Worse usage for us?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Worse it cannot be.<br />
My greyhound has fresh straw, and scraps, in his kennel;<br />
But we have neither.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Did I ever think<br />
To wear such garters on silk stockings? or<br />
That my too curious appetite, that turn'd<br />
At the sight of godwits, pheasant, partridge, quails,<br />
Larks, woodcocks, calver'd salmon<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>, as coarse diet,<br />
Would leap at a mouldy crust?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> And go without it,<br />
So oft as I do? Oh! how have I jeer'd<br />
The city entertainment! A huge shoulder<br />
Of glorious fat ram-mutton, seconded<br />
With a pair of tame cats or conies, a crab-tart,<br />
With a worthy loin of veal, and valiant capon,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>Mortified to grow tender!&mdash;these I scorn'd,<br />
From their plentiful horn of abundance, though invited:<br />
But now I could carry my own stool to a tripe<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>,<br />
And call their chitterlings charity, and bless the founder.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> O that I were no further sensible<br />
Of my miseries than you are! you, like beasts,<br />
Feel only stings of hunger, and complain not<br />
But when you're empty: but your narrow souls<br />
(If you have any) cannot comprehend<br />
How insupportable the torments are,<br />
Which a free and noble soul, made captive, suffers.<br />
Most miserable men!&mdash;and what am I, then,<br />
That envy you? Fetters, though made of gold,<br />
Express base thraldom; and all delicates<br />
Prepared by Median cooks for epicures,<br />
When not our own, are bitter: quilts fill'd high<br />
With gossamere and roses cannot yield<br />
The body soft repose, the mind kept waking<br />
With anguish and affliction.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> My good lord&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> This is no time nor place for flattery, sir:<br />
Pray you, style me as I am, a wretch forsaken<br />
Of the world, as myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
<i>Ast.</i> I would it were<br />
In me to help you.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> If that you want power, sir,<br />
Lip-comfort cannot cure me. Pray you, leave me<br />
To mine own private thoughts.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Walks by.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> [<i>comes forward.</i>] My valiant nephew!<br />
And my more than warlike ward! I am glad to see you,<br />
After your glorious conquests. Are these chains<br />
Rewards for your good service? if they are,<br />
You should wear them on your necks, since they are massy,<br />
Like aldermen of the war.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> You jeer us too!</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Good uncle, name not, as you are a man of honour,<br />
That fatal word of war; the very sound of it<br />
Is more dreadful than a cannon.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> But redeem us<br />
From this captivity, and I'll vow hereafter<br />
Never to wear a sword, or cut my meat<br />
With a knife that has an edge or point; I'll starve first.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> Well, have more wit hereafter: for this time<br />
You are ransom'd.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> Off with their irons!</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> Do, do:<br />
If you are ours again, you know your price.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Pray you, despatch us: I shall ne'er believe<br />
I am a free man, till I set my foot<br />
In Sicily again, and drink Palermo,<br />
And in Palermo too.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> The wind sits fair;<br />
You shall aboard to-night: with the rising sun<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>You may touch upon the coast. But take your leaves<br />
Of the late general first.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> I will be brief.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> And I. My lord, Heaven keep you!</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Yours, to use<br />
In the way of peace; but as your soldiers, never.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> A pox of war! no more of war.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Rod. Jac. Ant.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gasp.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Have you<br />
Authority to loose their bonds, yet leave<br />
The brother of your king, whose worth disdains<br />
Comparison with such as these, in irons?<br />
If ransom may redeem them, I have lands,<br />
A patrimony of mine own, assign'd me<br />
By my deceased sire, to satisfy<br />
Whate'er can be demanded for my freedom.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> I wish you had, sir; but the king, who yields<br />
No reason for his will, in his displeasure<br />
Hath seized on all you had; nor will Gonzaga,<br />
Whose prisoner now you are, accept of less<br />
Than fifty thousand crowns.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> I find it now,<br />
That misery never comes alone. But, grant<br />
The king is yet inexorable, time<br />
May work him to a feeling of my sufferings.<br />
I have friends that swore their lives and fortunes were<br />
At my devotion, and, among the rest,<br />
Yourself, my lord, when forfeited to the law<br />
For a foul murder, and in cold blood done,<br />
I made your life my gift, and reconciled you<br />
To this incensed king, and got your pardon.<br />
&mdash;Beware ingratitude! I know you are rich,<br />
And may pay down the sum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
<i>Ast.</i> I might, my lord;<br />
But pardon me.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> And will Astutio prove, then,<br />
To please a passionate man, (the king's no more,)<br />
False to his maker, and his reason, which<br />
Commands more than I ask? O summer friendship,<br />
Whose flattering leaves, that shadow'd us in our<br />
Prosperity, with the least gust drop off<br />
In the autumn of adversity! How like<br />
A prison is to a grave! when dead, we are<br />
With solemn pomp brought thither, and our heirs,<br />
Masking their joy in false dissembled tears,<br />
Weep o'er the herse; but earth no sooner covers<br />
The earth brought thither, but they turn away,<br />
With inward smiles, the dead no more remember'd:<br />
So, enter'd in a prison&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> My occasions<br />
Command me hence, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Pray you, leave me, do;<br />
And tell the cruel king, that I will wear<br />
These fetters till my flesh and they are one<br />
Incorporated substance. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Astutio</span>.] In myself,<br />
As in a glass, I'll look on human frailty,<br />
And curse the height of royal blood; since I,<br />
In being born near to Jove, am near his thunder<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.<br />
Cedars once shaken with a storm, their own<br />
Weight grubs their roots out.&mdash;Lead me where you please;<br />
I am his, not fortune's martyr, and will die<br />
The great example of his cruelty.

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Palermo. A Grove near the Palace.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> He undergoes my challenge, and contemns it,<br />
And threatens me with the late edict made<br />
'Gainst duellists,&mdash;the altar cowards fly to.<br />
But I, that am engaged, and nourish in me<br />
A higher aim than fair Camiola dreams of,<br />
Must not sit down thus. In the court I dare not<br />
Attempt him; and in public he's so guarded,<br />
With a herd of parasites, clients, fools, and suitors,<br />
That a musket cannot reach him:&mdash;my designs<br />
Admit of no delay. This is her birthday,<br />
Which, with a fit and due solemnity,<br />
Camiola celebrates: and on it, all such<br />
As love or serve her usually present<br />
A tributary duty. I'll have something<br />
To give, if my intelligence prove true,<br />
Shall find acceptance. I am told, near this grove<br />
Fulgentio, every morning, makes his markets<br />
With his petitioners; I may present him<br />
With a sharp petition!&mdash;&mdash;Ha! 'tis he: my fate<br />
Be ever bless'd for 't!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fulgentio</span> <i>and Page</i>.</p>

Not to presume, at the least for half an hour,<br />

Howe'er no sword, to kill him; and what way,<br />
This morning I'll resolve of.

<p><i>Ador.</i> I shall cross<br />
Your resolution, or suffer for you.<br />

<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span>, <i>followed by Servants with Presents</i>;
<span class="smcap">Sylli</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> What are all these?</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> Servants with several presents,<br />
And rich ones too.</p>

<p><i>1 Serv.</i> With her best wishes, madam,<br />
Of many such days to you, the lady Petula<br />
Presents you with this fan.</p>

<p><i>2 Serv.</i> This diamond,<br />
From your aunt Honoria.</p>

<p><i>3 Serv.</i> This piece of plate<br />
From your uncle, old Vicentio, with your arms<br />
Graven upon it.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Good friends, they are too<br />
Munificent in their love and favour to me.<br />
Out of my cabinet return such jewels<br />
As this directs you:&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>.]&mdash;for your pains; and yours;<br />
Nor must you be forgotten. [<i>Gives them money.</i>] Honour me<br />
With the drinking of a health.</p>

<p><i>2 Serv.</i> She scorns to give base silver.</p>

<p><i>3 Serv.</i> Would she had been<br />
Born every month in the year!</p>

<p><i>1 Serv.</i> Month! every day.</p>

<p><i>2 Serv.</i> Show such another maid.</p>

<p><i>3 Serv.</i> All happiness wait you!</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> I'll see your will done.<br />

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span> <i>wounded</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> How, Adorni wounded!</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> A scratch got in your service, else not worth<br />
Your observation: I bring not, madam,<br />
In honour of your birthday, antique plate,<br />
Or pearl, for which the savage Indian dives<br />
Into the bottom of the sea; nor diamonds<br />
Hewn from steep rocks with danger. Such as give<br />
To those that have, what they themselves want, aim at<br />
A glad return with profit: yet, despise not<br />
My offering at the altar of your favour;<br />
Nor let the lowness of the giver lessen<br />
The height of what's presented; since it is<br />
A precious jewel, almost forfeited,<br />
And dimm'd with clouds of infamy, redeem'd,<br />
And, in its natural splendour, with addition<br />
Restored to the true owner.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> How is this?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Not to hold you in suspense, I bring you, madam,<br />
Your wounded reputation cured, the sting<br />
Of virulent malice, festering your fair name,<br />
Pluck'd out and trod on. That proud man, that was<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>Denied the honour of your hand, yet durst,<br />
With his untrue reports, revile your fame,<br />
Compell'd by me, hath given himself the lie,<br />
And in his own blood wrote it:&mdash;you may read<br />
Fulgentio subscribed.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Offering a paper.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I am amazed!</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> It does deserve it, madam. Common service<br />
Is fit for hinds, and the reward proportion'd<br />
To their conditions: therefore, look not on me<br />
As a follower of your father's fortunes, or<br />
One that subsists on yours:&mdash;you frown! my service<br />
Merits not this asp&eacute;ct.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Which of my favours,<br />
I might say bounties, hath begot and nourish'd<br />
This more than rude presumption? Since you had<br />
An itch to try your desperate valour, wherefore<br />
Went you not to the war? Couldst thou suppose<br />
My innocence could ever fall so low<br />
As to have need of thy rash sword to guard it<br />
Against malicious slander? O how much<br />
Those ladies are deceived and cheated, when<br />
The clearness and integrity of their actions<br />
Do not defend themselves, and stand secure<br />
On their own bases! Such as in a colour<br />
Of seeming service give protection to them,<br />
Betray their own strengths. Malice scorn'd, puts out<br />
Itself; but argued, gives a kind of credit<br />
To a false accusation. In this, this your<br />
Most memorable service, you believed<br />
You did me right; but you have wrong'd me more<br />
In your defence of my undoubted honour,<br />
Than false Fulgentio could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
<i>Ador.</i> I am sorry what was<br />
So well intended is so ill received;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>.</p>

<p>Yet, under your correction, you wish'd<br />
Bertoldo had been present.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> True, I did:<br />
But he and you, sir, are not parallels,<br />
Nor must you think yourself so.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I am what<br />
You'll please to have me.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> If Bertoldo had<br />
Punish'd Fulgentio's insolence, it had shown<br />
His love to her whom, in his judgment, he<br />
Vouchsafed to make his wife; a height, I hope,<br />
Which you dare not aspire to. The same actions<br />
Suit not all men alike;&mdash;but I perceive<br />
Repentance in your looks. For this time, leave me;<br />
I may forgive, perhaps forget, your folly:<br />
Conceal yourself till this storm be blown over.<br />
You will be sought for; yet, if my estate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">[<i>Gives him her hand to kiss.</i></span><br />
Can hinder it, shall not suffer in my service.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span>.</span><br />
This gentleman is of a noble temper;<br />
And I too harsh, perhaps, in my reproof:<br />
Was I not, Clarinda?</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> I am not to censure<br />
Your actions, madam; but there are a thousand<br />
Ladies, and of good fame, in such a cause<br />
Would be proud of such a servant.</p>

<p><i>Cham.</i> It may be;

<p><i>Cam.</i> Never think more then.</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> They have been at court,<br />
Kiss'd the king's hand; and, their first duties done<br />
To him, appear ambitious to tender<br />
To you their second service.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Wait them hither.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Exit Servant.</i></span><br />
Fear, do not rack me! Reason, now, if ever,<br />
Haste with thy aids, and tell me, such a wonder<br />
As my Bertoldo is, with such care fashion'd,<br />
Must not, nay, cannot, in Heaven's providence</p>

<p>So soon miscarry!&mdash;pray you, forbear; ere you take<br />
The privilege, as strangers, to salute me,<br />

How it is with Bertoldo.</p>

Will not, I fear, deserve your thanks.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> I wish<br />
Some other should inform you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Is he dead?<br />
You see, though with some fear, I dare inquire it.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> Dead! Would that were the worst; a debt were paid then,<br />
Kings in their birth owe nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
<i>Cam.</i> Is there aught<br />
More terrible than death?</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> Yes, to a spirit<br />
Like his; cruel imprisonment, and that<br />
Without the hope of freedom.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You abuse me<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>:<br />
The royal king cannot, in love to virtue,<br />
(Though all springs of affection were dried up,)<br />
But pay his ransom.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> When you know what 'tis,<br />
You will think otherwise: no less will do it<br />
Than fifty thousand crowns.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> A petty sum,<br />
The price weigh'd with the purchase: fifty thousand!<br />
To the king 'tis nothing. He that can spare more<br />
To his minion for a masque, cannot but ransom<br />
Such a brother at a million. You wrong<br />
The king's magnificence.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> In your opinion;<br />
But 'tis most certain: he does not alone<br />
In himself refuse to pay it, but forbids<br />
All other men.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Are you sure of this?</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> You may read<br />
The edict to that purpose, publish'd by him;<br />
That will resolve you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Possible! pray you, stand off.<br />
If I do not mutter treason to myself,<br />
My heart will break; and yet I will not curse him;<br />
He is my king. The news you have deliver'd<br />
Makes me weary of your company; we'll salute<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>When we meet next. I'll bring you to the door.<br />
Nay, pray you, no more compliments.</p>

<p><i>Gasp.</i> One thing more,<br />
And that's substantial: let your Adorni<br />
Look to himself.</p>

<p><i>Ant.</i> The king is much incensed<br />
Against him for Fulgentio.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> As I am,<br />
For your slowness to depart.</p>

<p><i>Both.</i> Farewell, sweet lady.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Gasparo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> O more than impious times! when not alone<br />
Subordinate ministers of justice are<br />
Corrupted and seduced, but kings themselves,<br />
The greater wheels by which the lesser move,<br />
Are broken, or disjointed! could it be, else,<br />
A king, to sooth his politic ends, should so far<br />
Forsake his honour, as at once to break<br />
The adamant chains of nature and religion,<br />
To bind up atheism<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, as a defence<br />
To his dark counsels? Will it ever be,<br />
That to deserve too much is dangerous,<br />
And virtue, when too eminent, a crime?<br />
Must she serve fortune still, or, when stripp'd of<br />
Her gay and glorious favours, lose the beauties<br />
Of her own natural shape? O, my Bertoldo,<br />
Thou only sun in honour's sphere, how soon<br />
Art thou eclipsed and darken'd! not the nearness<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>Of blood prevailing on the king; nor all<br />
The benefits to the general good dispensed,<br />
Gaining a retribution! But that<br />
To owe a courtesy to a simple virgin<br />
Would take from the deserving, I find in me<br />
Some sparks of fire, which, fann'd with honour's breath,<br />
Might rise into a flame, and in men darken<br />
Their usurp'd splendour. Ha! my aim is high,<br />
And, for the honour of my sex, to fall so,<br />
Can never prove inglorious.&mdash;'Tis resolved:<br />
Call in Adorni.</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> I am happy in<br />
Such an employment, madam.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> He's a man,<br />
I know, that at a reverent distance loves me;<br />
And such are ever faithful. What a sea<br />
Of melting ice I walk on! what strange censures<br />
Am I to undergo! but good intents<br />
Deride all future rumours.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span> <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I obey<br />
Your summons, madam.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Leave the place, Clarinda;<br />
One woman, in a secret of such weight,<br />
Wise men may think too much: [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>.] nearer, Adorni.<br />
I warrant it with a smile.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I cannot ask<br />
Safer protection; what's your will?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> To doubt<br />
Your ready desire to serve me, or prepare you<br />
With the repetition of former merits,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>Would, in my diffidence, wrong you: but I will,<br />
And without circumstance, in the trust that I<br />
Impose upon you, free you from suspicion.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I foster none of you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I know you do not.<br />
You are, Adorni, by the love you owe me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> The surest conjuration.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Take me with you<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.&mdash;<br />
Love born of duty; but advance no further.<br />
You are, sir, as I said, to do me service,<br />
To undertake a task, in which your faith,<br />
Judgment, discretion&mdash;in a word, your all<br />
That's good, must be engaged; nor must you study,<br />
In the execution, but what may make<br />
For the ends I aim at.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> They admit no rivals.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You answer well. You have heard of Bertoldo's<br />
Captivity, and the king's neglect; the greatness<br />
Of his ransom; fifty thousand crowns, Adorni;<br />
Two parts of my estate!</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> To what tends this?
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Yet I so love the gentleman, for to you<br />
I will confess my weakness, that I purpose<br />
Now, when he is forsaken by the king,<br />
And his own hopes, to ransom him, and receive him<br />
Into my bosom, as my lawful husband&mdash;<br />
Why change you colour?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> 'Tis in wonder of<br />
Your virtue, madam.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You must, therefore, to<br />
Sienna for me, and pay to Gonzaga<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>This ransom for his liberty; you shall have<br />
Bills of exchange along with you. Let him swear<br />
A solemn contract to me; for you must be<br />
My principal witness, if he should&mdash;but why<br />
Do I entertain these jealousies? You will do this?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Faithfully, madam&mdash;but not live long after.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> One thing I had forgot: besides his freedom,<br />
He may want accomodations; furnish him<br />
According to his birth.<br />
I'll instantly despatch you.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Was there ever<br />
Poor lover so employ'd against himself,<br />
To make way for his rival? I must do it,<br />
Nay, more, I will. If loyalty can find<br />
Recompense beyond hope or imagination,<br />
Let it fall on me in the other world,<br />
As a reward, for in this I dare not hope it.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>


<h3>ACT IV. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Siennese. A Camp before the Walls of Sienna.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gonzaga</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pierio</span>.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> You have seized upon the citadel, and disarm'd<br />
All that could make resistance?</p>

<p><i>Pier.</i> Hunger had<br />
Done that, before we came; nor was the soldier<br />
Compell'd to seek for prey: the famish'd wretches,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>In hope of mercy, as a sacrifice offer'd<br />
All that was worth the taking.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Where is the duke of Urbin?</p>

<p><i>Pier.</i> Under guard,<br />
As you directed.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> See the soldiers set<br />
In rank and file, and, as the duchess passes,<br />
Bid them vail their ensigns.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Loud music. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Roderigo, Jacomo</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Aurelia</span>
<i>under a Canopy</i>. <span class="smcap">Astutio</span> <i>presents her
with letters</i>.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> But for these aids from Sicily sent against us,<br />
To blast our spring of conquest in the bud;<br />
I cannot find, my lord ambassador,<br />
How we should entertain 't but as a wrong,<br />
With purpose to detain us from our own,<br />
Howe'er the king endeavours, in his letters,<br />
To mitigate the affront.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> Your grace hereafter<br />
May hear from me such strong assurances<br />
Of his unlimited desires to serve you,<br />
As will, I hope, drown in forgetfulness<br />
The memory of what's past.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> We shall take time<br />
To search the depth of 't further, and proceed<br />
As our council shall direct us.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> We present you<br />
With the keys of the city; all lets are removed,<br />
Your way is smooth and easy; at your feet<br />
Your proudest enemy falls.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> We thank your valours:<br />
A victory without blood is twice achieved,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>And the disposure of it, to us tender'd,<br />
The greatest honour. Worthy captains, thanks!<br />
My love extends itself to all.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Make way there.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>A Guard drawn up</i>;</span> <span class="smcap">Aurelia</span> <i>passes through them</i>. <i>Loud music.</i>
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>


<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Sienna. A Room in the Prison.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bertoldo</span> <i>is discovered in fetters, reading</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> 'Tis here determined, (great examples, arm'd<br />
With arguments, produced to make it good,)<br />
That neither tyrants, nor the wrested laws,<br />
The people's frantic rage, sad exile, want,<br />
Nor that which I endure, captivity,<br />
Can do a wise man any injury.<br />
Thus Seneca, when he wrote it, thought.&mdash;But then<br />
Felicity courted him; his wealth exceeding<br />
A private man's; happy in the embraces<br />
Of his chaste wife Paulina; his house full<br />
Of children, clients, servants, flattering friends,<br />
Soothing his lip-positions; and created<br />
Prince of the senate, by the general voice,<br />
At his new pupil's suffrage: then, no doubt,<br />
He held, and did believe, this. But no sooner<br />
The prince's frowns and jealousies had thrown him<br />
Out of security's lap, and a centurion<br />
Had offer'd him what choice of death he pleased,<br />
But told him, die he must; when straight the armour<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>Of his so boasted fortitude fell off,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">[<i>Throws away the book.</i></span><br />
Complaining of his frailty. Can it then<br />
Be censured womanish weakness in me, if,<br />
Thus clogg'd with irons, and the period<br />
To close up all calamities denied me,<br />
Which was presented Seneca, I wish<br />
I ne'er had being; at least, never knew<br />
What happiness was; or argue with heaven's justice,<br />
Tearing my locks, and, in defiance, throwing<br />
Dust in the air? or, falling on the ground, thus<br />
With my nails and teeth to dig a grave, or rend<br />
The bowels of the earth, my step-mother,<br />
And not a natural parent? or thus practise<br />
To die, and, as I were insensible,<br />
Believe I had no motion?
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Falls on his face.</i></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gonzaga, Adorni</span>, <i>and Gaoler</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> There he is:<br />
I'll not inquire by whom his ransom's paid,<br />
I am satisfied that I have it; nor allege<br />
One reason to excuse his cruel usage,<br />
As you may interpret it: let it suffice<br />
It was my will to have it so. He is yours now,<br />
Dispose of him as you please.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Howe'er I hate him,<br />
As one preferr'd before me, being a man,<br />
He does deserve my pity. Sir!&mdash;he sleeps:&mdash;<br />
Or he is dead?&mdash;[<i>kneels by him.</i>]&mdash;No, he breathes! Come near,<br />
And, if 't be possible, without his feeling,<br />
Take off his irons.&mdash;[<i>His irons taken off.</i>]&mdash;So; now leave us private.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exit Gaoler.</i></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>He does begin to stir; and, as transported<br />
With a joyful dream, how he stares! and feels his legs,<br />
As yet uncertain whether it can be<br />
True or fantastical.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> [<i>rising.</i>] Ministers of mercy,<br />
Mock not calamity. Ha! 'tis no vision!<br />
Or, if it be, the happiest that ever<br />
Appear'd to sinful flesh! Who's here? his face<br />
Speaks him Adorni;&mdash;but some glorious angel,<br />
Concealing its divinity in his shape,<br />
Hath done this miracle, it being not an act<br />
For wolfish man. Resolve me, if thou look'st for<br />
Bent knees in adoration?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> O forbear, sir!<br />
I am Adorni, and the instrument<br />
Of your deliverance; but the benefit<br />
You owe another.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> If he has a name,<br />
As soon as spoken, 'tis writ on my heart<br />
I am his bondman.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> To the shame of men,<br />
This great act is a woman's.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> The whole sex<br />
For her sake must be deified. How I wander<br />
In my imagination, yet cannot<br />
Guess who this ph&oelig;nix should be!</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> 'Tis Camiola.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Pray you, speak 't again; there's music in her name.<br />
Once more, I pray you, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Camiola,<br />
The <span class="smcap lowercase">MAID OF HONOUR</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Cursed atheist that I was,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>Only to doubt it could be any other;<br />
Since she alone, in the abstract of herself,<br />
That small, but ravishing substance, comprehends<br />
Whatever is, or can be wish'd, in the<br />
Idea of a woman! O what service,<br />
Or sacrifice of duty, can I pay her,<br />
If not to live and die her charity's slave,<br />
Which is resolved already!</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> She expects not<br />
Such a dominion o'er you. You must now,<br />
Which is the sum of all that she desires,<br />
By a solemn contract bind yourself, when she<br />
Requires it, as a debt due for your freedom,<br />
To marry her.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> This does engage me further;<br />
A payment! an increase of obligation.<br />
To marry her!&mdash;'twas my <i>nil ultra</i> ever:<br />
The end of my ambition. O that now<br />
The holy man, she present, were prepared<br />
To join our hands, but with that speed my heart<br />
Wishes mine eyes might see her!</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> You must swear this.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> False to Camiola! never.&mdash;Shall I now<br />
Begin my vows to you?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I am no churchman;<br />
Such a one must file it on record: you are free;<br />
And, that you may appear like to yourself,<br />
(For so she wish'd,) here's gold, with which you may<br />
Redeem your trunks and servants, and whatever<br />
Of late you lost. I have found out the captain<br />
Whose spoil they were; his name is Roderigo.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> I know him.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I have done my parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
<i>Bert.</i> So much, sir,<br />
As I am ever yours for 't. Now, methinks,<br />
I walk in air! Divine Camiola&mdash;&mdash;<br />
But words cannot express thee: I'll build to thee<br />
An altar in my soul, on which I'll offer<br />
A still-increasing sacrifice of duty.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> What will become of me now is apparent.<br />
This Roman resolution of self-murder<br />
Will not hold water at the high tribunal,<br />
When it comes to be argued; my good Genius<br />
Prompts me to this consideration. He<br />
That kills himself to avoid misery, fears it,<br />
And, at the best, shows but a bastard valour.<br />
This life's a fort committed to my trust,<br />
Which I must not yield up till it be forced:<br />
Nor will I. He's not valiant that dares die,<br />
But he that boldly bears calamity.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>


<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A State-room in the Palace.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>A Flourish. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pierio, Roderigo, Jacomo,
Gonzaga, Aurelia, Ferdinand, Astutio</span>, <i>and
Attendants</i>.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> A seat here for the duke. It is our glory<br />
To overcome with courtesies, not rigour;<br />
The lordly Roman, who held it the height<br />
Of human happiness to have kings and queens<br />
To wait by his triumphant chariot-wheels,<br />
In his insulting pride, deprived himself<br />
Of drawing near the nature of the gods,<br />
Best known for such, in being merciful.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>Yet, give me leave, but still with gentle language,<br />
And with the freedom of a friend, to tell you,<br />
To seek by force, what courtship could not win,<br />
Was harsh, and never taught in Love's mild school.<br />
Wise poets feign that Venus' coach is drawn<br />
By doves and sparrows, not by bears and tigers.<br />
I spare the application.</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> In my fortune,<br />
Heaven's justice hath confirm'd it; yet, great lady,<br />
Since my offence grew from excess of love,<br />
And not to be resisted, having paid, too,<br />
With loss of liberty, the forfeiture<br />
Of my presumption, in your clemency<br />
It may find pardon.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> You shall have just cause<br />
To say it hath. The charge of the long siege<br />
Defray'd, and the loss my subjects have sustain'd<br />
Made good, since so far I must deal with caution,<br />
You have your liberty.</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> I could not hope for<br />
Gentler conditions.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> My lord Gonzaga,<br />
Since my coming to Sienna, I've heard much of<br />
Your prisoner, brave Bertoldo.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Such an one,<br />
Madam, I had.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> And have still, sir, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Your hopes deceive you. He is ransom'd, madam.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> By whom, I pray you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> You had best inquire<br />
Of your intelligencer: I am no informer.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> I like not this.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> He is, as 'tis reported,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>A goodly gentleman, and of noble parts;<br />
A brother of your order.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> He was, madam,<br />
Till he, against his oath, wrong'd you, a princess,<br />
Which his religion bound him from.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Great minds,<br />
For trial of their valours, oft maintain<br />
Quarrels that are unjust, yet without malice;<br />
And such a fair construction I make of him:<br />
I would see that brave enemy.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> My duty<br />
Commands me to seek for him.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Pray you do;<br />
And bring him to our presence.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Gonzaga</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> I must blast<br />
His entertainment. [<i>Aside.</i>] May it please your excellency.<br />
He is a man debauch'd, and, for his riots,<br />
Cast off by the king my master; and that, I hope, is<br />
A crime sufficient.</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> To you, his subjects,<br />
That like as your king likes.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> But not to us;<br />
We must weigh with our own scale.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gonzaga</span>, <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Bertoldo</span> <i>richly habited,
and</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">This is he, sure.</span><br />
How soon mine eye had found him! what a port<br />
He bears! how well his bravery becomes him!<br />
A prisoner! nay, a princely suitor, rather!<br />
But I'm too sudden.
<span style="margin-left:8em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Madam, 'twas his suit,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>Unsent for, to present his service to you,<br />
Ere his departure.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> With what majesty<br />
He bears himself!
<span style="margin-left:9em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> The devil, I think, supplies him.<br />
Ransom'd, and thus rich too!</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> You ill deserve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<span class="smcap">Bertoldo</span>, <i>kneeling, kisses her hand</i>.</span><br />
The favour of our hand&mdash;&mdash;we are not well,<br />
Give us more air.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Descends suddenly.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> What sudden qualm is this?</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i>&mdash;That lifted yours against me.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Thus, once more,<br />
I sue for pardon.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Sure his lips are poison'd,<br />
And through these veins force passage to my heart,<br />
Which is already seized on.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> I wait, madam,<br />
To know what your commands are; my designs<br />
Exact me in another place.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Before<br />
You have our licence to depart! If manners,<br />
Civility of manners, cannot teach you<br />
To attend our leisure, I must tell you, sir,<br />
That you are still our prisoner; nor had you<br />
Commission to free him.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> How's this, madam?</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> You were my substitute, and wanted power,<br />
Without my warrant, to dispose of him:<br />
I will pay back his ransom ten times over,<br />
Rather than quit my interest.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> This is<br />
Against the law of arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
<i>Aurel.</i> But not of love.
<span style="margin-left:9em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br />
Why, hath your entertainment, sir, been such,<br />
In your restraint, that, with the wings of fear,<br />
You would fly from it?</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> I know no man, madam,<br />
Enamour'd of his fetters, or delighting<br />
In cold or hunger, or that would in reason<br />
Prefer straw in a dungeon before<br />
A down-bed in a palace.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> How!&mdash;Come nearer:<br />
Was his usage such?</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Yes, and it had been worse,<br />
Had I foreseen this.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> O such as thou, that have<br />
No share in nature's bounties, know no pity<br />
To such as have them. Look on him with my eyes,<br />
And answer, then, whether this were a man<br />
Whose cheeks of lovely fulness should be made<br />
A prey to meagre famine? or these eyes,<br />
Whose every glance store Cupid's emptied quiver,<br />
To be dimm'd with tedious watching? or these lips,<br />
These ruddy lips, of whose fresh colour cherries<br />
And roses were but copies, should grow pale<br />
For want of nectar? or these limbs, that bear<br />
A burthen of more worth than is supported<br />
By Atlas' wearied shoulders, should be cramp'd<br />
With the weight of iron? O, I could dwell ever<br />
On this description!</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Is this in derision,<br />
Or pity of me?</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> In your charity<br />
Believe me innocent. Now you are my prisoner,<br />
You shall have fairer quarter: you will shame<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>The place where you have been, should you now leave it,<br />
Before you are recover'd. I'll conduct you<br />
To more convenient lodgings, and it shall be<br />
My care to cherish you. Repine who dare;<br />
It is our will. You'll follow me?</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> To the centre,<br />
Such a Sybilla guiding me.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Aurelia, Bertoldo</span>, <i>and Attendants</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Who speaks first?</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> We stand as we had seen Medusa's head.</p>

<p><i>Pier.</i> I know not what to think, I am so amazed.</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> Amazed! I am thunderstruck.</p>

<p><i>Jac.</i> We are enchanted,<br />
And this is some illusion.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Heaven forbid!<br />
In dark despair it shows a beam of hope:<br />
Contain thy joy, Adorni.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> Such a princess,<br />
And of so long experienced reservedness,<br />
Break forth, and on the sudden, into flashes<br />
Of more than doubted love!</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> They come again,<br />
Smiling, as I live!&mdash;Some fury hath possess'd her.<br />
If I speak, I may be blasted.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bertoldo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Aurelia</span>.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Let not, sir,<br />
The violence of my passion nourish in you<br />
An ill opinion; or, grant my carriage<br />
Out of the road and garb of private women,<br />
'Tis still done with decorum.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Gracious madam,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>Vouchsafe a little pause; for I am so rapt<br />
Beyond myself, that, till I have collected<br />
My scatter'd faculties, I cannot tender<br />
My resolution.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Consider of it:<br />
I will not be long from you.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">[<span class="smcap">Bertoldo</span> <i>walks by musing</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Pray you, fair lady,<br />
If you can, in courtesy direct me to<br />
The chaste Aurelia.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Are you blind? who are we?</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Another kind of thing. Her love was govern'd<br />
By her discretion, and not ruled her reason:<br />
The reverence and majesty of Juno<br />
Shined in her looks, and, coming to the camp,<br />
Appear'd a second Pallas. I can see<br />
No such divinities in you: if I,<br />
Without offence, may speak my thoughts, you are,<br />
As 'twere, another Helen.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Good! ere long<br />
You shall know me better.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Why, if you are Aurelia,<br />
How shall I dispose of the soldier?</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> May it please you<br />
To hasten my despatch?</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Prefer your suits<br />
Unto Bertoldo; we will give him hearing,<br />
And you'll find him your best advocate.
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> This is rare!</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> What are we come to?</p>

<p><i>Rod.</i> Grown up in a moment<br />
A favourite!</p>

<p><i>Ferd.</i> He does take state already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
<i>Bert.</i> No, no; it cannot be:&mdash;yet, but Camiola,<br />
There is no step between me and a crown.<br />
Then my ingratitude! a sin in which<br />
All sins are comprehended! Aid me, Virtue,<br />
Or I am lost!</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> May it please your excellence&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Second me, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Then my so horrid oaths,<br />
And hell-deep imprecations made against it!</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> The king, your brother, will thank you for the advancement<br />
Of his affairs.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> And yet who can hold out<br />
Against such batteries as her power and greatness<br />
Raise up against my weak defences?</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Sir,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aurelia</span>.</p>

<p>Do you dream waking? 'Slight, she's here again!<br />
Walks she on woollen feet<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>!</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> You dwell too long<br />
In your deliberation, and come<br />
With a cripple's pace to that which you should fly to.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> It is confess'd: yet why should I, to win<br />
From you, that hazard all to my poor nothing,<br />
By false play send you off a loser from me?<br />
I am already too, too much engaged<br />
To the king my brother's anger; and who knows<br />
But that his doubts and politic fears, should you<br />
Make me his equal, may draw war upon<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>Your territories? Were that breach made up,<br />
I should with joy embrace what now I fear<br />
To touch but with due reverence.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> That hinderance<br />
Is easily removed. I owe the king<br />
For a royal visit, which I straight will pay him;<br />
And having first reconciled you to his favour,<br />
A dispensation shall meet with us.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> I am wholly yours.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> On this book seal it.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> What, hand and lip too! then the bargain's sure.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
You have no employment for me?</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Yes, Gonzaga;<br />
Provide a royal ship.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> A ship! St. John,<br />
Whither are we bound now?</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> You shall know hereafter.<br />
My lord, your pardon for my too much trenching<br />
Upon your patience.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Camiola!
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Bertoldo</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> How do you?</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Indisposed; but I attend you.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">[<i>Exeunt all but</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> The heavy curse that waits on perjury<br />
And foul ingratitude pursue thee ever!<br />
Yet why from me this? in his breach of faith<br />
My loyalty finds reward: what poisons him,<br />
Proves mithridate<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> to me. I have perform'd<br />
All she commanded, punctually; and now,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>In the clear mirror of my truth, she may<br />
Behold his falsehood. O that I had wings<br />
To hear me to Palermo! This, once known,<br />
Must change her love into a just disdain,<br />
And work her to compassion of my pain.

<h3>SCENE IV.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Palermo. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sylli, Camiola</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span>, <i>at several
doors.</i></p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Undone! undone!&mdash;poor I, that whilome was<br />
The top and ridge of my house, am, on the sudden,<br />
Turn'd to the pitifullest animal<br />
O' the lineage of the Syllis!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> What's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> The king&mdash;break, girdle, break!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Why, what of him?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Hearing how far you doted on my person,<br />
Is come himself a suitor, with the awl<br />
Of his authority to bore my nose,<br />
And take you from me&mdash;Oh, oh, oh!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Do not roar so:<br />
The king!</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> The king. Yet loving Sylli is not<br />
So sorry for his own as your misfortune:<br />
If the king should carry you, he can but make you<br />
A queen, and what a simple thing is that<br />
To the being my lawful spouse! the world can never<br />
Afford you such a husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
<i>Cam.</i> I believe you.<br />
But how are you sure the king is so inclined?<br />
Did not you dream this?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> With these eyes I saw him<br />
Dismiss his train, and lighting from his coach,<br />
Whispering Fulgentio in the ear.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> If so,<br />
I guess the business.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Yonder they are; I dare not</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Roberto</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fulgentio</span>.</p>

<p>Be seen, I am so desperate: if you forsake me,<br />
Send me word, that I may provide a willow garland,<br />
To wear when I drown myself. O Sylli, Sylli!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Exit crying.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> It will be worth your pains, sir, to observe<br />
The constancy and bravery of her spirit.<br />
Though great men tremble at your frowns, I dare<br />
Hazard my head your majesty, set off<br />
With terror, cannot fright her.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> May she answer<br />
My expectation!
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> There she is.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> My knees thus<br />
Bent to the earth, while my vows are sent upward<br />
For the safety of my sovereign, pay the duty<br />
Due for so great an honour, in this favour<br />
Done to your humblest handmaid.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> You mistake me;<br />
I come not, lady, that you may report<br />
The king, to do you honour, made your house<br />
(He being there) his court; but to correct<br />
Your stubborn disobedience. A pardon<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>For that, could you obtain it, were well purchased<br />
With this humility.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> A pardon, sir!<br />
Till I am conscious of an offence,<br />
I will not wrong my innocence to beg one.<br />
What is my crime, sir?</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Look on him I favour,<br />
By you scorn'd and neglected.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Is that all, sir?</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> No, minion; though that were too much. How can you<br />
Answer the setting on your desperate bravo<br />
To murder him?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> With your leave, I must not kneel, sir,<br />
While I reply to this: but thus rise up<br />
In my defence, and tell you, as a man,<br />
(Since, when you are unjust, the deity,<br />
Which you may challenge as a king, parts from you,)<br />
'Twas never read in holy writ, or moral,<br />
That subjects on their loyalty were obliged<br />
To love their sovereign's vices: your grace, sir,<br />
To such an undeserver is no virtue.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> What think you now, sir?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Say you should love wine,<br />
You being the king, and, 'cause I am your subject,<br />
Must I be ever drunk? Tyrants, not kings,<br />
By violence, from humble vassals force<br />
The liberty of their souls. I could not love him;<br />
And to compel affection, as I take it,<br />
Is not found in your prerogative.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Excellent virgin!<br />
How I admire her confidence!
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> He complains<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>Of wrong done him: but be no more a king,<br />
Unless you do me right. Burn your decrees,<br />
And of your laws and statutes make a fire<br />
To thaw the frozen numbness of delinquents,<br />
If he escape unpunish'd. Do your edicts<br />
Call it death in any man that breaks into<br />
Another's house to rob him, though of trifles;<br />
And shall Fulgentio, your Fulgentio, live,<br />
Who hath committed more than sacrilege,<br />
In the pollution of my clear fame<br />
By his malicious slanders?</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Have you done this?<br />
Answer truly, on your life.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> In the heat of blood,<br />
Some such thing I reported.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Out of my sight!<br />
For I vow, if by true penitence thou win not<br />
This injured lady to sue out thy pardon,<br />
Thy grave is digg'd already.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> By my own folly<br />
I have made a fair hand of 't.
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Aside, and Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> You shall know, lady,<br />
While I wear a crown, Justice shall use her sword<br />
To cut offenders off, though nearest to us.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Ay, now you show whose deputy you are:<br />
If now I bathe your feet with tears, it cannot<br />
Be censured superstition.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> You must rise;<br />
Rise in our favour and protection ever.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Kisses her.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Happy are subjects, when the prince is still<br />
Guided by justice, not his passionate will.<br />

<h3>ACT V. SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span>'<i>s House</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Camiola</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sylli</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You see how tender I am of the quiet<br />
And peace of your affection, and what great ones<br />
I put off in your favour.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> You do wisely,<br />
Exceeding wisely; and, when I have said,<br />
I thank you for 't, be happy.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> And good reason,<br />
In having such a blessing.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> When you have it;<br />
But the bait is not yet ready.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Clarinda</span> <i>hastily</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> What news with thee, now?</p>

<p><i>Clar.</i> Off with that gown, 'tis mine; mine by your promise:<br />
Signior Adorni is return'd! now upon entrance!<br />
Off with it, off with it, madam!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Be not so hasty:<br />
When I go to bed, 'tis thine.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> You have my grant too;<br />
But, do you hear, lady, though I give way to this,<br />
You must hereafter ask my leave, before<br />
You part with things of moment.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Very good;<br />
When I'm yours I'll be govern'd.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Sweet obedience!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> You are well return'd.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I wish that the success<br />
Of my service had deserved it.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Lives Bertoldo?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Yes, and return'd with safety.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> 'Tis not then<br />
In the power of fate to add to, or take from<br />
My perfect happiness; and yet&mdash;he should<br />
Have made me his first visit.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> So I think too;<br />
But he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Durst not appear, I being present;<br />
That's his excuse, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Speak, where is he?<br />
With whom? who hath deserved more from him? or<br />
Can be of equal merit? I in this<br />
Do not except the king.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> He's at the palace,<br />
With the duchess of Sienna. One coach brought them hither,<br />
Without a third: he's very gracious with her;<br />
You may conceive the rest.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> My jealous fears<br />
Make me to apprehend.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Pray you, dismiss<br />
Signior Wisdom, and I'll make relation to you<br />
Of the particulars.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Servant, I would have you<br />
To haste unto the court.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I will outrun<br />
A footman for your pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
<i>Cam.</i> There observe<br />
The duchess' train, and entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Fear not;<br />
I will discover all that is of weight,<br />
To the liveries of her pages and her footmen.<br />
This is fit employment for me.
<span style="margin-left:5em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Gracious with<br />
The duchess! sure you said so?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> I will use<br />
All possible brevity to inform you, madam,<br />
Of what was trusted to me, and discharged<br />
With faith and loyal duty.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I believe it;<br />
You ransomed him, and supplied his wants&mdash;imagine<br />
That is already spoken; and what vows<br />
Of service he made to me, is apparent;<br />
His joy of me, and wonder too, perspicuous;<br />
Does not your story end so?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Would the end<br />
Had answered the beginning!&mdash;In a word,<br />
Ingratitude and perjury at the height<br />
Cannot express him.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Take heed.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> Truth is arm'd,<br />
And can defend itself. It must out, madam:<br />
I saw (the presence full) the amorous duchess<br />
Kiss and embrace him; on his part accepted<br />
With equal ardour; and their willing hands<br />
No sooner join'd, but a remove was publish'd,<br />
And put in execution.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> The proofs are<br />
Too pregnant. O Bertoldo!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
<i>Ador.</i> He's not worth<br />
Your sorrow, madam.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Tell me, when you saw this,<br />
Did not you grieve, as I do now to hear it?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> His precipice from goodness raising mine,<br />
And serving as a foil to set my faith off,<br />
I had little reason.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> In this you confess<br />
The malice of your disposition. As<br />
You were a man, you stood bound to lament it;<br />
And not, in flattery of your false hopes,<br />
To glory in it. When good men pursue<br />
The path mark'd out by virtue, the blest saints<br />
With joy look on it, and seraphic angels<br />
Clap their celestial wings in heavenly plaudits,<br />
To see a scene of grace so well presented,<br />
The fiends, and men made up of envy, mourning.<br />
Whereas now, on the contrary, as far<br />
As their divinity can partake of passion,<br />
With me they weep, beholding a fair temple,<br />
Built in Bertoldo's loyalty, turn'd to ashes<br />
By the flames of his inconstancy, the damn'd<br />
Rejoicing in the object.&mdash;'Tis not well<br />
In you, Adorni.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> What a temper dwells<br />
In this rare virgin! [<i>Aside.</i>] Can you pity him,<br />
That hath shown none to you?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I must not be<br />
Cruel by his example. You, perhaps,<br />
Expect now I should seek recovery<br />
Of what I have lost, by tears, and with bent knees<br />
Beg his compassion. No; my towering virtue,<br />
From the assurance of my merit, scorns<br />
To stoop so low. I'll take a nobler course,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>And, confident in the justice of my cause,<br />
The king his brother, and new mistress, judges,<br />
Ravish him from her arms. You have the contract,<br />
In which he swore to marry me?</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> 'Tis here, madam.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> He shall be, then, against his will, my husband;<br />
And when I have him, I'll so use him!&mdash;Doubt not,<br />
But that, your honesty being unquestion'd,<br />
This writing, with your testimony, clears all.</p>

<p><i>Ador.</i> And buries me in the dark mists of error.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I'll presently to court; pray you, give order<br />
For my caroch<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span>.] My good angel help me,<br />
In these my extremities!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sylli</span>.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> If you e'er will see brave sight,<br />
Lose it not now. Bertoldo and the duchess<br />
Are presently to be married: there's such pomp<br />
And preparation!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> If I marry, 'tis<br />
This day, or never.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Why, with all my heart;<br />
Though I break this, I'll keep the next oath I make,<br />
And then it is quit.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Follow me to my cabinet;<br />
You know my confessor, father Paulo?</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Yes: shall he<br />
Do the feat for us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
<i>Cam.</i> I will give in writing<br />
Directions to him, and attire myself<br />
Like a virgin bride; and something I will do,<br />
That shall deserve men's praise and wonder too.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>


<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The same. A State-room in the Palace.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Loud music. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Roberto, Bertoldo, Aurelia,
Ferdinand, Astutio, Gonzaga, Roderigo,
Jacomo, Pierio</span>, <i>a Bishop, and Attendants</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Had our division been greater, madam,<br />
Your clemency, the wrong being done to you,<br />
In pardon of it, like the rod of concord,<br />
Must make a perfect union.&mdash;Once more,<br />
With a brotherly affection, we receive you<br />
Into our favour: let it be your study<br />
Hereafter to deserve this blessing, far<br />
Beyond your merit.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> As the princess' grace<br />
To me is without limit, my endeavours,<br />
With all obsequiousness to serve her pleasures,<br />
Shall know no bounds: nor will I, being made<br />
Her husband, e'er forget the duty that<br />
I owe her as a servant.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> I expect not<br />
But fair equality, since I well know,<br />
If that superiority be due,<br />
'Tis not to me. When you are made my consort,<br />
All the prerogatives of my high birth cancell'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>I'll practise the obedience of a wife,<br />
And freely pay it.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> This done, as it is promised, may well stand for<br />
A precedent to great women.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> One word more<br />
Touching the articles.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fulgentio, Camiola, Sylli</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adorni</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ful.</i> In you alone<br />
Lie all my hopes; you can or kill or save me;<br />
But pity in you will become you better<br />
(Though I confess injustice 'tis denied me)<br />
Than too much rigour.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I will make your peace<br />
As far as it lies in me; but must first<br />
Labour to right myself.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Or add or alter<br />
What you think fit; in him I have my all:<br />
Heaven make me thankful for him!</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> On to the temple.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Stay, royal sir; and, as you are a king,<br />
Erect one<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> here, in doing justice to<br />
An injured maid.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> How's this?</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> O, I am blasted!</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> I have given some proof, sweet lady, of my promptness<br />
To do you right; you need not, therefore, doubt me;<br />
And rest assured, that, this great work despatch'd,<br />
You shall have audience, and satisfaction<br />
To all you can demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
<i>Cam.</i> To do me justice<br />
Exacts your present care, and can admit<br />
Of no delay. If, ere my cause be heard,<br />
In favour of your brother you go on, sir,<br />
Your sceptre cannot right me. He's the man,<br />
The guilty man, whom I accuse; and you<br />
Stand bound in duty, as you are supreme,<br />
To be impartial. Since you are a judge,<br />
As a delinquent look on him, and not<br />
As on a brother: Justice painted blind,<br />
Infers her ministers are obliged to hear<br />
The cause, and truth, the judge, determine of it;<br />
And not sway'd or by favour or affection,<br />
By a false gloss, or wrested comment, alter<br />
The true intent and letter of the law.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Nor will I, madam.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> You seem troubled, sir.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> His colour changes too.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> The alteration<br />
Grows from his guilt. The goodness of my cause<br />
Begets such confidence in me, that I bring<br />
No hired tongue to plead for me, that with gay<br />
Rhetorical flourishes may palliate<br />
That which, stripp'd naked, will appear deform'd.<br />
I stand here mine own advocate; and my truth,<br />
Deliver'd in the plainest language, will<br />
Make good itself; nor will I, if the king<br />
Give suffrage to it, but admit of you,<br />
My greatest enemy, and this stranger prince,<br />
To sit assistants with him.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> I ne'er wrong'd you.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> In your knowledge of the injury, I believe it;<br />
Nor will you, in your justice, when you are<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>Acquainted with my interest in this man,<br />
Which I lay claim to.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Let us take our seats.<br />
What is your title to him?</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> By this contract,<br />
Seal'd solemnly before a reverend man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">[<i>Presents a paper to the king.</i></span><br />
I challenge him for my husband.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Ha! was I<br />
Sent for the friar for this?</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> This writing is<br />
Authentical.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> But, done in heat of blood,<br />
Charm'd by her flatteries, as, no doubt, he was,<br />
To be dispensed with.</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> Add this, if you please,<br />
The distance and disparity between<br />
Their births and fortunes.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> What can Innocence hope for,<br />
When such as sit her judges are corrupted!<br />
Disparity of birth or fortune, urge you?<br />
Or syren charms? or, at his best, in me<br />
Wants to deserve him? Call some few days back,<br />
And, as he was, consider him, and you<br />
Must grant him my inferior. Imagine<br />
You saw him now in fetters, with his honour,<br />
His liberty lost; with her black wings Despair<br />
Circling his miseries, and this Gonzaga<br />
Trampling on his afflictions; the great sum<br />
Proposed for his redemption; the king<br />
Forbidding payment of it; his near kinsmen,<br />
With his protesting followers and friends,<br />
Falling off from him; by the whole world forsaken;<br />
Dead to all hope, and buried in the grave<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>Of his calamities; and then weigh duly<br />
What she deserved, whose merits now are doubted,<br />
That, as his better angel, in her bounties<br />
Appear'd unto him, his great ransom paid,<br />
His wants, and with a prodigal hand, supplied;<br />
Whether, then, being my manumised slave,<br />
He owed not himself to me?</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Is this true?</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> In his silence 'tis acknowledged.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> If you want<br />
A witness to this purpose, I'll depose it.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> If I have dwelt too long on my deservings<br />
To this unthankful man, pray you pardon me;<br />
The cause required it. And though now I add<br />
A little, in my painting to the life<br />
His barbarous ingratitude, to deter<br />
Others from imitation, let it meet with<br />
A fair interpretation. This serpent,<br />
Frozen to numbness, was no sooner warm'd<br />
In the bosom of my pity and compassion,<br />
But, in return, he ruin'd his preserver,<br />
The prints the irons had made in his flesh<br />
Still ulcerous; but all that I had done,<br />
My benefits, in sand or water written,<br />
As they had never been, no more remember'd!<br />
And on what ground, but his ambitious hopes<br />
To gain this duchess' favour?</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> Yes; the object,<br />
Look on it better, lady, may excuse<br />
The change of his affection.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> The object!<br />
In what? forgive me, modesty, if I say<br />
You look upon your form in the false glass<br />
Of flattery and self-love, and that deceives you.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>That you were a duchess, as I take it, was not<br />
Character'd on your face; and, that not seen,<br />
For other feature, make all these, that are<br />
Experienced in women, judges of them,<br />
And, if they are not parasites, they must grant,<br />
For beauty without art, though you storm at it,<br />
I may take the right-hand file.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Well said, i' faith!<br />
I see fair women on no terms will yield<br />
Priority in beauty.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Down, proud heart!<br />
Why do I rise up in defence of that,<br />
Which, in my cherishing of it, hath undone me!<br />
No, madam, I recant,&mdash;you are all beauty,<br />
Goodness, and virtue; and poor I not worthy<br />
As a foil to set you off: enjoy your conquest;<br />
But do not tyrannize. Yet, as I am,<br />
In my lowness, from your height you may look on me,<br />
And, in your suffrage to me, make him know<br />
That, though to all men else I did appear<br />
The shame and scorn of women, he stands bound<br />
To hold me as the masterpiece.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> By my life,<br />
You have shown yourself of such an abject temper,<br />
So poor and low-condition'd, as I grieve for<br />
Your nearness to me.</p>

<p><i>Fer.</i> I am changed in my<br />
Opinion of you, lady; and profess<br />
The virtues of your mind an ample fortune<br />
For an absolute monarch.</p>

<p><i>Gonz.</i> Since you are resolved<br />
To damn yourself, in your forsaking of<br />
Your noble order for a woman, do it<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>For this. You may search through the world, and meet not<br />
With such another ph&oelig;nix.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> On the sudden<br />
I feel all fires of love quench'd in the water<br />
Of my compassion.&mdash;Make your peace; you have<br />
My free consent; for here I do disclaim<br />
All interest in you: and, to further your<br />
Desires, fair maid, composed of worth and honour,<br />
The dispensation procured by me,<br />
Freeing Bertoldo from his vow, makes way<br />
To your embraces.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> Oh, how have I stray'd,<br />
And wilfully, out of the noble track<br />
Mark'd me by virtue! till now, I was never<br />
Truly a prisoner. To excuse my late<br />
Captivity, I might allege the malice<br />
Of Fortune; you, that conquer'd me, confessing<br />
Courage in my defence was no way wanting.<br />
But now I have surrender'd up my strengths<br />
Into the power of Vice, and on my forehead<br />
Branded, with mine own hand, in capital letters,<br />
<span class="smcap">Disloyal</span>, and <span class="smcap">Ingrateful</span>. Though barr'd from<br />
Human society, and hiss'd into<br />
Some desert ne'er yet haunted with the curses<br />
Of men and women, sitting as a judge<br />
Upon my guilty self, I must confess<br />
It justly falls upon me; and one tear,<br />
Shed in compassion of my sufferings, more<br />
Than I can hope for.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> This compunction<br />
For the wrong that you have done me, though you should<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>Fix here, and your true sorrow move no further,<br />
Will, in respect I loved once, make these eyes<br />
Two springs of sorrow for you.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> In your pity<br />
My cruelty shows more monstrous: yet I am not,<br />
Though most ingrateful, grown to such a height<br />
Of impudence, as, in my wishes only,<br />
To ask your pardon. If, as now I fall<br />
Prostrate before your feet, you will vouchsafe<br />
To act your own revenge, treading upon me<br />
As a viper eating through the bowels of<br />
Your benefits, to whom, with liberty,<br />
I owe my being, 'twill take from the burden<br />
That now is insupportable.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> Pray you, rise;<br />
As I wish peace and quiet to my soul,<br />
I do forgive you heartily: yet, excuse me,<br />
Though I deny myself a blessing that,<br />
By the favour of the duchess, seconded<br />
With your submission, is offer'd to me;<br />
Let not the reason I allege for 't grieve you,<br />
You have been false once.&mdash;I have done: and if,<br />
When I am married, as this day I will be,<br />
As a perfect sign of your atonement with me,<br />
You wish me joy, I will receive it for<br />
Full satisfaction of all obligations<br />
In which you stand bound to me.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> I will do it,<br />
And, what's more, in despite of sorrow, live<br />
To see myself undone, beyond all hope<br />
To be made up again.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> My blood begins<br />
To come to my heart again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
<i>Cam.</i> Pray you, signior Sylli,<br />
Call in the holy friar: he's prepared<br />
For finishing the work.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I knew I was<br />
The man: heaven make me thankful!
<span style="margin-left:3em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Who is this?</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> His father was the banker of Palermo,<br />
And this the heir of his great wealth: his wisdom<br />
Was not hereditary.</p>

<p><i>Aurel.</i> For my part,<br />
I cannot guess the issue.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sylli</span> <i>with Father</i> <span class="smcap">Paulo</span>.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> Do your duty;<br />
And with all speed you can, you may despatch us.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> Thus, as a principal ornament to the church,<br />
I seize her.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> So young, and so religious!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> She has forsook the world.</p>

<p><i>Syl.</i> I shall run mad.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> Hence with the fool! [<span class="smcap">Sylli</span> <i>is thrust off</i>.] Proceed, sir.</p>

<p>Paul. <i>Look on this</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">MAID OF HONOUR</span>, <i>now<br />

Instead of dainties, from the spring,<br />

With saints and angels, say, Amen</i>!</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> This is the marriage! this the port to which<br />
My vows must steer me! Fill my spreading sails<br />
With the pure wind of your devotions for me,<br />
That I may touch the secure haven, where<br />
Eternal happiness keeps her residence,<br />
Temptations to frailty never entering!<br />
I am dead to the world, and thus dispose<br />
Of what I leave behind me; and, dividing<br />
My state into three parts, I thus bequeath it:<br />
The first to the fair nunnery, to which<br />
I dedicate the last and better part<br />
Of my frail life; a second portion<br />
To pious uses; and the third to thee,<br />
Adorni, for thy true and faithful service.<br />
And, ere I take my last farewell, with hope<br />
To find a grant, my suit to you is, that<br />
You would, for my sake, pardon this young man,<br />
And to his merits love him, and no further.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> I thus confirm it.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Gives his hand to</i></span> <span class="smcap">Fulgentio</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> And, as e'er you hope,
<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bertoldo</span>.</span><br />
Like me, to be made happy, I conjure you<br />
To reassume your order; and in fighting<br />

Redeem your mortgaged honour.</p>

<span style="margin-left:2em;">[<i>Gives him the white cross.</i></span><br />
Once more, brothers in arms.</p>

<p><i>Bert.</i> I'll live and die so.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> To you my pious wishes! And, to end<br />
All differences, great sir, I beseech you<br />
To be an arbitrator, and compound<br />
The quarrel long continuing between<br />
The duke and duchess.</p>

<p><i>Rob.</i> I will take it into<br />
My special care.</p>

<p><i>Cam.</i> I am then at rest. Now, father,<br />
Conduct me where you please.<br />

Her name, <i>the Maid of Honour</i>! May she stand,<br />
To all posterity, a fair example<br />
For noble maids to imitate! Since to live<br />
In wealth and pleasure's common, but to part with<br />
Such poison'd baits is rare; there being nothing<br />
Upon this stage of life to be commended,<br />
Though well begun, till it be fully ended.<br />

This word, which is directly

Slaves to thy power</i>, &amp;c.]
I have observed several imitations
of Massinger in the dramas of Mason: there is, for instance, a
striking similarity between this spirited speech, and the indignant
exclamation of the brave but unfortunate Caractacus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"Soldier, I had arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had neighing steeds to whirl my iron cars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had wealth, dominions: dost thou wonder, Roman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fought to save them? What if C&aelig;sar aims<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lord it universal o'er the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall the world tamely crouch to C&aelig;sar's footstool?"<br /></span>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> <i>And do 't with safety.</i>]
This is admirably expressed: the
maxim, however, though just, is of the most dangerous nature;
for what ambitious chief will ever allow the state to be "raised
to her perfection," or that the time for using "mercy with
safety" is arrived? Even Dioclesian has his exceptions,&mdash;strong
ones too! for Rome was old enough in his time. There is an
allusion to Virgil, in the opening of this speech:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Res dura, et novitas regni me talia cogunt</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Moliri, &amp;c.</i><br /></span>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Gifford.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<i>as weak Perseus<br />
Did great &AElig;milius.</i>]
It is said that Perseus sent to desire
Paulus &AElig;milius not to exhibit him as a spectacle to the
Romans, and to spare him the indignity of being led in triumph.
&AElig;milius replied coldly: <i>The favour he asks of me is in his
own power; he can procure it for himself</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coxeter.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> <i>To match where they affect not.</i>]
This does better for
modern than Roman practice; and, indeed, the author was
thinking more of Hamlet than Dioclesian, in this part of the
dialogue.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gifford.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> <i>Owes</i>.]

The idea of
this double effect, to which Massinger has more than one allusion,
is from Ovid:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Filius huic Veneris; figat tuus omnia, Ph&oelig;be,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Te meus arcus, ait:&mdash;Parnassi constitit arce,</i><br /></span>

A <i>bandog</i>, as the name imports, was a dog so fierce,
as to require to be chained up. Bandogs are frequently mentioned
by our old writers (indeed the word occurs three times in this
play) and always with a reference to their savage nature. If
the term was appropriated to a species, it probably meant a
large dog, of the mastiff kind, which, though no longer met
with here, is still common in many parts of Germany: it was
familiar to Snyders, and is found in most of his hunting-pieces.</p>

<p>In this country the bandog was kept to bait bears: with the
decline of that sport, perhaps, the animal fell into disuse, as he
was too ferocious for any domestic purpose. Mr. Gilchrist has
furnished me with a curious passage from Laneham, which
renders any further details on the subject unnecessary. "On
the syxth day of her Majestyes cumming, a great sort of <i>bandogs</i>
whear thear tyed in the utter coourt, and thyrteen bears in
the inner. Whoosoever made the pannel, thear wear enoow
for a queast, and one for a challenge and need wear. A wight
of great wisdoom and gravitie seemed their foreman to be, had
it cum to a jury: but it fell oout that they wear causd to appeer

looking him over again, I can scarcely find a trace of it. Herodotus
has, indeed, a story of a king of Egypt (Amasis),
which bears a distant resemblance to it; but the application is
altogether different:&mdash;there is a <i>bason of gold</i> in which he and
his guests were accustomed to spit, <i>wash their feet</i>, &amp;c. which
is formed <i>into a god</i>; but whether this furnished the poet with
any hints I cannot undertake to say.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gifford.</span></p></div>

beam moved on a swivel. At this the competitors ran with
their spears couched, with loose reins, and, as the public regulations
have it, "as much speed as the horses have." The
object was to carry off the ring on the point of the spear,
which was light, taper, and adapted to the purpose. It was of
difficult attainment; for, from an account of a match made by
King Edward the Sixth, seventeen against seventeen, of which
he has left a description, it appears, that "in one hundred and

very correct in his enumeration of the articles which in his time
made up a complete signior: and which are frequently introduced
with evident marks of disapprobation and ridicule by our
old poets. The ruff, cloak, and long stocking, are sufficiently
familiar: <i>hose</i> are breeches: <i>paned hose</i> are breeches composed
of small squares or pannels. <i>Toothpicks</i>, the next accompaniment
of state, were newly imported from Italy, as were <i>forks</i>;

<p>It seems to have been the opinion of Massinger and his
fellow dramatists, that no play could succeed without the admission
of some kind of farcical interlude among the graver
scenes. If the dramas of our author be intimately considered,
few will be found without some extraneous mummery of this
description; and, indeed, nothing but a persuasion of the nature
which I have just mentioned could give birth to the poor
mockery before us. As a trick, it is so gross and palpable,
that the duke could not have been deceived by it for a moment;
(to do him justice, he frequently hints his suspicions;)
and as a piece of humour, it is so low, and even disagreeable,
that I cannot avoid regretting a proper regard for his characters

attempt to impose upon the great duke is more deplorable than
the former. It has falsehood and improbability written on its

author showed a strange want of judgment in this gratuitous degradation
of three of his most estimable characters.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gifford.</span></p>

<p>Surely Massinger intended that his characters should here be
understood as speaking the truth. The contrivance by which
he exculpates Giovanni is a clumsy one; but he was anxious
to conclude his play, and took the first that suggested itself.
Awkward as it may appear to the reader, it has, perhaps,
quite enough dramatic probability to satisfy an audience.</p></div>

Mr. Gilchrist thinks
(and I believe rightly) that Massinger, who evidently regarded
the Duke of Buckingham with no favourable eye, here reflects
on the use of sedan-chairs, which his grace first introduced, from
Spain, about this period. They were carried, as Massinger
says, "on men's shoulders," and the novelty provoked no small
displeasure against the favourite, who, in thus employing his
servants, was charged, by the writers of those times, with "degrading
Englishmen into slaves and beasts of burden, to gratify
his inordinate vanity."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gifford.</span></p></div>

This was a raised platform, on which was
placed a chair with a canopy over it. The word occurs perpetually
in our old writers. It is used by Dryden, but seems to
have been growing obsolete while he was writing: in the first
edition of Mac Fleckno, the monarch is placed on a <i>state</i>; in
the subsequent ones, he is seated like his fellow kings, on a
throne: it occurs also, and I believe for the last time, in Swift:
"As she affected not the grandeur of a <i>state</i> with a canopy, she
thought there was no offence in an elbow chair."&mdash;<i>Hist. of

To one ambitious of rule</i>, &amp;c.] Massinger has here finely
drawn the character of Timoleon, and been very true to history.
He was descended from one of the noblest families in Corinth,
loved his country passionately, and discovered upon all occasions
a singular humanity of temper, except against tyrants
and bad men. He was an excellent captain; and as in his
youth he had all the maturity of age, in age he had all the fire

Timoleon had an
elder brother, called Timophanes, whom he tenderly loved, as
he had demonstrated in a battle, in which he covered him with
his body, and saved his life at the great danger of his own.
But his country was still dearer to him. That brother having
made himself tyrant of it, so black a crime gave him the sharpest
affliction. He made use of all possible means to bring him back
to his duty: kindness, friendship, affection, remonstrances, and
even menaces. But finding all his endeavours ineffectual, and
that nothing could prevail upon a heart abandoned to ambition
he caused his brother to be assassinated by two of his friends
and intimates, and thought that upon such an occasion the
laws of nature ought to give place to those of his country.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coxeter.</span></p></div>

This pleasant old

and thought only of their country. Whatever region was the
subject, England was the real theme: their habits, customs,
peculiarities were all derived from thence. This, though it
must condemn them as historians, may save them as patriots:
and, indeed, it is not much to be regretted that they should
overlook manners, with which they were very imperfectly acquainted,
in favour of those with which they were hourly conversant&mdash;at

has imitated them in his Miser, without adding much to their
humour; and Foote, in The Minor, has servilely followed his
example. The spectators of those scenes probably thought
that the writers had gone beyond real life, and drawn on imagination
for their amusement: but transactions (not altogether

They were a set of needy bravoes,
who undertook to ascertain the authentic grounds of a
quarrel, and in some cases to settle it, for the timorous or unskilful.
In the punctilious days of our author, all matters
relative to duelling were arranged, in set treatises, with a
gravity that, in a business less serious, would be infinitely
ridiculous. Troops of disbanded soldiers, or rather of such
as pretended to be so, took up the "noble science of arms,"
and, with the use of the small sword, (then a novelty,) taught
a jargon respecting the various modes of "honourable quarrelling,"
which, though seemingly calculated to baffle alike the
patience and the understanding, was a fashionable object of
study. The dramatic poets, faithful to the moral end of their
high art, combated this contagious folly with the united powers
of wit and humour; and, after a long and well-conducted struggle,
succeeded in rendering it as contemptible as it was odious,
and finally suppressed it altogether.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gifford.</span></p></div>

many of our old writers, use <i>parallels</i> for <i>radii</i>.</p>

<p>In the life of Dr. H. More (1710) there is a letter to a correspondent
who had sent him a pious treatise, in which the
same expression occurs, and is thus noticed by the doctor:
"There is but one passage that I remember, which will afford
them (the profane and atheistical rout of the age) a disingenuous
satisfaction; which is in p. 489, where you say that <i>straight
lines drawn from the centre run parallel together</i>. To a candid
reader your intended sense can be no other than that they run
&#960;&#945;&#8165; &#945;&#955;&#955;&#7969;&#955;&#945;&#962;, that is, by one another; which they may do,
though they do not run all along equidistantly one by another,
which is the mathematical sense of the word parallel."&mdash;<i>Gent.
Mag.</i> May, 1782. The good doctor is, I think, the best critic
on the subject that has yet appeared, and sufficiently explains
Massinger.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gifford.</span></p></div>
